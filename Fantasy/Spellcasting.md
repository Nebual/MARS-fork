# Spellcasting

There are several different ways to cast spells, as represented by these skills: *animism*, *arcana*, *faith*, *ki*, and *power*. Each skill represents a different method and motivation for casting spells. When you become trained in one of these skills, you also will pick a specialization of that skill. Unless otherwise stated, whenever you advance in a spellcasting skill, you will learn a new spell to cast with that skill. Similarly, when your character starts with a spellcasting skill, they start with spells known in the same way based on your advancement. The highest difficulty spell you can learn is determined by the dice step you are advancing to.

##### Table: Spell Learning Difficulty Limits
| Roll Value | Step Name | Highest Difficulty |
|:-:|:-|:-|
| r4 | Trained | 7 (Moderate) |
| r6 | Adept | 10 (Hard) |
| r8 | Practiced | 10 (Hard) |
| r10 | Proficient | 14 (Challenging) |
| r12 | Exceptional | 14 (Challenging) |
| r14 | Disciplined | 14 (Challenging) |
| r16 | Accomplished | 19 (Ambitious) |
| r18 | Expert | 19 (Ambitious) |
| r20 | Master | 19 (Ambitious) |

To cast a spell you must perform the following steps:

1. Wait for the complete duration required to cast that spell.
2. Roll your spellcasting skill and associated stat versus the spell's difficulty.
3. If you succeed, spend mana equal to that spell's cost. If you fail, spend 1 mana instead. If somehow you can't, the spells fumbles instead.
4. Perform the effects of that spell based on your degree of success.
5. The targets (if any) may roll to resist the effects of that spell (if allowed).

Although failing to cast a spell causes it to do nothing (while still spending 1 mana), *fumbling* a spell causes unintended effects based on the spell fumbled. The exact nature of these effects is to be determined by the game master based on the spell attempted. 

If the targets of your spells choose to resist them, they roll their stat to resist as specified by that spell. Unless a spell states otherwise, resisting a spell negates all effects of that spell on that target. When a target rolls to resist that spell, they are rolling an opposed check against the roll you already made to cast that spell. If the recipients of that spell are granted future opportunities to resist that spell, they will continue to roll resist checks against the same value.

Whenever a spell refers to your *spellcasting stat* it means the stat that your spellcasting skill is associated with.

You may choose to downgrade how well you cast a spell if you want to cast a lesser version instead (your roll is the same, and you choose a lower success category).

# Spells

Even though many different spellcasting skills have different methods and motivations, they may cast some similar spells. Spells will have listed specializations of a spellcasting skill required to learn those spells. Most spells can be used by at least a couple specializations.

Spells may deal various types of *magical damage*. By default, all magical damage bypasses damage reduction, unless the spell is blocked. Magical damage types are anything that is not specifically listed as physical damage (blunt, piercing, and slashing). The types of magical damage are: *arcane*, *cold*, *electric*, and *fire*.

Some spells will have a listed duration with the word *concentration* or some other condition listed. This means that the spell will last either until the duration is met, or the condition is fulfilled. Spells requiring concentration last as long as you decide to maintain concentration on that spell, until the duration is exceeded, or you become stunned or unconscious. You may only concentrate on a single spell requiring it any given time. If any other condition is listed, then the spell ends as soon as that condition is met or broken. If a concentration spell ends while you are still maintaining concentration, you may spend the mana cost of that spell to renew its duration.

Additional spells cast during the same turn get a â€“2 penalty to cast for each spell cast before it in the same turn. This penalty applies to all forms of spells cast. This is known as the *multiple spell penalty*. Spells cast as a reaction are exempt from this penalty (such as by a readied action).

## Alter Size

**Specializations:** Enchantment, Transmutation  
**Difficulty:** 10 (Hard)

**Mana Cost:** 2  
**Action Speed:** Standard

**Range:** 3m  
**Target:** One creature or object  
**Duration:** 5 minutes (concentration)  
**Resist:** Willpower

Increase or decrease the size category of a creature or object. You may change size an additional size category by raising mana cost by 1 and difficulty by 2 for each category after the first. Changing the size category of a creature also modifies its stats. It will receive +1 Strength per increase or -1 Strength per decrease, as well as -1 Dexterity per two increases (rounded up) or +1 Dexterity per two decreases (rounded up).

For example: If your target was Medium sized and you increased it to Huge (three size increases) it would get +3 Strength and -2 Dexterity. This would cost 4 mana with a difficulty of 14.

## Animal Form

**Specializations:** Animism (Bonus: Practiced)  
**Difficulty:** 10 (Hard)

**Mana Cost:** 2  
**Action Speed:** Standard

**Target:** Self  
**Duration:** Indefinite (concentration)

You take the form of any animal you can imagine. Specifically, you transform into any beast type creature. For each size category that beast has in difference to yours, increase the mana cost of this spell by 1 and the difficulty by 2. Additionally, if that creature is a magical beast, treat that as an additional difference in size in terms of calculating the cost.

While transformed, your physical primary stats (Strength and Dexterity) temporarily become that of the chosen beast. As this is a temporary change, your resource stats are not affected, but you will use your transformed Strength and Dexterity values when making a roll (such as when rolling deflection, evasion, fortitude, willpower, etc.)

Additionally, you acquire any natural weapons, abilities (but not talents), and even movement speed that beast might have. While in this form your physical equipment still exists and can still provide magical effects, but otherwise you are no longer considered to have your weapons and armour eqiupped. You lose the ability to speak normally, and you may not cast other spells (you may still cast this spell if you wanted to change directly into another animal).

For example: If you are a Medium sized creature and you wanted to transform into a bear, which is a Very Large beast, it would cost you 4 mana with a difficulty of 14. This would change your strength to r16+3 and your dexterity to r14-1, even if they were higher. Your movement speed would also change to 14m.

## Arcane Missiles

**Specializations:** Arcane, Conjuration, Evocation  
**Difficulty:** 10 (Hard)

**Mana Cost:** 2  
**Action Speed:** Swift

**Range:** 20m  
**Target:** One or more creatures or objects  
**Resist:** Deflection (for half)

You shoot arcane missiles dealing r8+1 arcane damage. These missiles always hit their targets, but may be resisted for half damage (rounded up).

***Critical:*** Shoot three missiles.  
***Success:*** Shoot two missiles.  
***Graze:*** Shoot one missile.

## Armour

**Specializations:** Arcane, Conjuration, Enchantment, Militarism  
**Difficulty:** 10 (Hard)

**Mana Cost:** 2  
**Action Speed:** Standard

**Range:** Touch  
**Target:** One creature  
**Duration:** 5 minutes (concentration)  
**Resist:** Willpower

You create a suit of magical armour on the target of your spell. It has an armour class and damage reduction similar to armour, but it has no weight or strength requirements. Additionally, this armour is capable of reducing magical damage unlike real armour. If a character wearing the arcane armour is also wearing real body armour, use whatever values are higher between the arcane and real armour. Even so, arcane armour will always remove any weaknesses that the real armour would have had, and still provides the ability to reduce damage from magic. It does not remove any other features of the real armour (such as the weight, strength requirement, or any noise it might produce).

***Critical:*** 5 armour class and 7 damage reduction.  
***Success:*** 3 armour class and 5 damage reduction.  
***Graze:*** 2 armour class and 3 damage reduction.

## Darkness

**Specializations:** Conjuration, Darkness, Entropy  
**Difficulty:** 10 (Hard)

**Mana Cost:** 2  
**Action Speed:** Swift

**Range:** Touch  
**Target:** One object or surface  
**Duration:** 30 minutes (concentration, range of 30m)  
**Resist:** Willpower

You touch an object or surface, causing it to consume nearly all light in a 10m radius. In a dark area like an unlit cave, the darkness is unnoticeable. Creatures who require light to see are treated as blinded while they are within the darkness radius. This spell and the light spell cancel each other out.

## Debilitate

**Specializations:** Air (Dexterity), Earth (Strength), Enchantment, Entropy, Fire (Resolve), Water (Intelligence)  
**Difficulty:** 14 (Hard)

**Mana Cost:** 3  
**Action Speed:** Standard

**Range:** 6m  
**Target:** One creature  
**Duration:** 12 seconds (until used) or 5 minutes (concentration)  
**Resist:** Willpower

Choose a primary stat (strength, intelligence, dexterity, or resolve). That stat becomes debilitated (any rolls made using that stat have disadvantage) to target creature. This spell can be used with reduced duration and providing disadvantage for only one roll by reducing the mana cost to 2.

## Detect Thoughts

**Specializations:** Augury, Authority, Light  
**Difficulty:** 14 (Challenging)

**Mana Cost:** 3  
**Action Speed:** Swift

**Range:** 3m  
**Target:** One creature  
**Duration:** Instant or 5 minutes (concentration)  
**Resist:** Willpower

Allows you to read the active thoughts of another creature without them knowing you are doing so. You may also choose to read their deep thoughts and memories, but if you do, the target will know you are in their mind. The target may only resist the spell if they know that their thoughts are being read, and may do so at any time (once per round).

***Critical:*** Allows you to read deep thoughts without alerting the target to your presence.  
***Graze:*** The target will know you are reading their thoughts.

## Enhance

**Specializations:** Air (Dexterity), Earth (Strength), Enchantment, Fire (Resolve), Harmony, Water (Intelligence)  
**Difficulty:** 19 (Challenging)

**Mana Cost:** 4  
**Action Speed:** Standard

**Range:** 6m  
**Target:** One creature  
**Duration:** 12 seconds (until used) or 5 minutes (concentration)  
**Resist:** Willpower

Choose a primary stat (strength, intelligence, dexterity, or resolve). That stat becomes enhanced (any rolls made using that stat have advantage) to target creature. This spell can be used with reduced duration and providing advantage for only one roll by reducing the mana cost to 3.

## Enhance Self

**Specializations:** Discipline, Genki (Strength), Kiai (Dexterity), Shouki (Intelligence), Yuuki (Resolve)  
**Difficulty:** 19 (Challenging)

**Mana Cost:** 4  
**Action Speed:** Swift

**Target:** Self  
**Duration:** 12 seconds (until used) or 5 minutes (concentration)

This spell functions exactly like the spell enhance, but it can only be cast on yourself. This spell has the added bonus of being faster to cast (swift instead of standard action speed).

## Feather Fall

**Specializations:** Air, Discipline, Enchantment, Kiai, Liberty, Transmutation  
**Difficulty:** 7 (Moderate)

**Mana Cost:** 1  
**Action Speed:** Reaction

**Range:** 10m  
**Target:** One or more creatures or objects  
**Duration:** 1 minute (concentration, landing)  
**Resist:** Willpower

Reduces the speed that you fall to a slow enough speed that you can always land safely. This spell can also be used to double the length of a jump due to the reduced falling speed. This spell's mana cost and difficulty increase by 1 for each additional creature and object you target.

## Grease

**Specializations:** Conjuration, Water  
**Difficulty:** 10 (Hard)

**Mana Cost:** 2  
**Action Speed:** Standard

**Range:** 10m  
**Target:** One point  
**Duration:** 5 minutes  
**Resist:** Acrobatics (vs grease), Fortitude (vs ignition)

Creates a thin pool of slippery grease in a 3m radius. Any character who starts their turn or steps onto or through the greasy area must resist using Acrobatics or they fall prone. Characters that do not treat the greasy area as difficult terrain get disadvantage to their resist roll. This effect occurs every time one of those characters attempts to move while still in the greasy area. The grease can be ignited, which also gives burning 2 to any character who starts their turn or steps onto or through the greasy area. This burning effect can only be given once per turn and can be resisted with Fortitude (causing burning 1 instead). Ignited grease lasts half as long. The range and radius of this spell can both be simultaneously increased by 1m by increasing this spell's mana cost by 1 and difficulty by 2.

## Harm

**Specializations:** Balance, Darkness, Earth, Entropy, Genki, Militarism, Transmutation, Water  
**Difficulty:** 10 (Hard)

**Mana Cost:** 2  
**Action Speed:** Standard

**Range:** Touch  
**Target:** One object or creature  
**Resist:** Fortitude

This spell can be used to destroy small mundane objects made of wood or stone, break part of a larger object, or cause wounds to a creature. Creatures affected by this spell gain the dying effect if they have negative health, even if they still have positive endurance. This spell may be used to have same effect on undead creatures as the spell mend does on living creatures.

***Critical:*** Deal r24 damage, and 1 bonus damage directly to health (this bonus damage cannot be prevented in any way).  
***Success:*** Deal r16 damage.  
***Graze:*** Deal r8 damage.

## Ignite

**Specializations:** Evocation, Fire, Impulse, Transmutation  
**Difficulty:** 7 (Moderate)

**Mana Cost:** 1  
**Action Speed:** Swift

**Range:** Touch or 3m  
**Target:** One creature or object  
**Resist:** Deflection

You apply a small burst of heat to a nearby object or creature, dealing fire damage. This spell can be used to light flammable material instantly. If you target a creature with this spell that is wearing cloth armour or just clothes, reduce their resist roll by 2. Wet targets get advantage to resist this spell, but if they fail they become dry instead of taking damage.

***Critical:*** Deal r12 fire damage, and the target gets burning 2.  
***Success:*** Deal r10 fire damage, and the target gets burning 1.  
***Graze:*** Deal r8 fire damage.

## Inspire

**Specializations:** Altruism, Evocation, Fire, Harmony, Impulse, Yuuki  
**Difficulty:** 10 (Hard)

**Mana Cost:** 2  
**Action Speed:** Standard

**Range:** Touch or 20m  
**Target:** One creature  
**Duration:** 1 minute (until used)  
**Resist:** Willpower

You lay your hand upon another creature, providing it comfort and a feeling of greater confidence. They get an advantage to the next skill check they perform. You may cast this spell at a range by speaking inspiring words, but the spell will cost 3 mana instead.

## Jolt

**Specializations:** Air, Evocation, Impulse, Transmutation  
**Difficulty:** 7 (Moderate)

**Mana Cost:** 1  
**Action Speed:** Swift

**Range:** Touch or 3m  
**Target:** One creature or object  
**Resist:** Deflection

You apply a small pulse of electricity to a nearby object or creature, dealing electric damage. This spell can also be used to recharge or activate simple devices that use electricity. Creatures targeted by this spell ignore any armour class they get from metal armour while attempting to resist this spell, but double the armour class from any leather armour. Targets that are wet get a disadvantage to resist this spell. If this spell targets a body of water, it effects all objects and creatures within 6m from the targeted point, contained or connected to that body of water.

***Critical:*** Deal r20 electric damage, and the target becomes stunned.  
***Success:*** Deal r14 electric damage.  
***Graze:*** Deal r8 electric damage.

## Knock

**Specializations:** Augury, Authority, Entropy, Light, Transmutation  
**Difficulty:** 14 (Challenging)

**Mana Cost:** 3  
**Action Speed:** Extended (1 minute)

**Range:** Touch  
**Target:** One locked object

You touch a physically locked object and it becomes unlocked. This spell works on all objects with physical locking mechanisms; it does not work on magically locked objects. When this spell is cast, regardless of success, it also creates a very loud sound. This sound is similar to a hammer slamming into a door with intent to break it.

## Light

**Specializations:** Altruism, Augury, Conjuration, Enchantment, Fire, Harmony, Liberty, Light  
**Difficulty:** 7 (Moderate)

**Mana Cost:** 1  
**Action Speed:** Swift

**Range:** Touch  
**Target:** One object or surface  
**Duration:** 1 hour (concentration, range of 30m)  
**Resist:** Willpower

You touch an object or surface, causing it to radiate light like a torch in a 10m radius. The colour of this light can be any colour of your choice. In daylight or a well lit area, the magical light is unnoticeable unless it has a specified colour (but still weak). Creatures who are sensitive to bright lights are treated as blinded while they are within the light radius. This spell and the darkness spell cancel each other out.

## Magic Weapon

**Specializations:** Air (Electric), Arcane, Enchantment, Fire, Militarism, Transmutation, Water (Cold)  
**Difficulty:** 10 (Hard)

**Mana Cost:** 2  
**Action Speed:** Standard

**Range:** Touch  
**Target:** One weapon  
**Duration:** 5 minutes (concentration)

You touch a weapon, granting it temporary magical properties. It deals half of its damage as a magical damage type of your choice (bypassing half damage reduction). Based on the chosen damage type, the weapon also applies an additional effect when it deals critical hits. The lethal parts of the weapon visually emanate a magical effect based on the damage type chosen. If this spell is used on a ranged weapon that requires ammunition, that weapon will generate magical ammunition as the weapon is used or armed as appropriate.

***Arcane:*** The attacked target loses r4 mana.  
***Cold:*** The attacked target loses r4 stamina.  
***Electric:*** The attacked target becomes stunned.  
***Fire:*** The attacked target gets burning 1.

## Mend

**Specializations:** Altruism, Balance, Charity (Bonus: Adept), Discipline, Earth, Harmony, Liberty, Light, Transmutation, Water, Yuuki  
**Difficulty:** 10 (Hard)

**Mana Cost:** 2  
**Action Speed:** Standard

**Range:** Touch  
**Target:** One object or creature  
**Resist:** Fortitude

This spell can be used to repair any broken mundane objects, fuse two objects of a similar material, or treat superficial wounds to a creature. Creatures affected by this spell are automatically stabilized. This spell may be used to have the same effect on undead creatures as the spell harm does on living creatures.

***Critical:*** Restore 1 health, and r24 endurance.  
***Success:*** Restore r16 endurance.  
***Graze:*** Restore r8 endurance.

## Message

**Specializations:** Air, Augury, Enchantment, Liberty, Light, Shouki  
**Difficulty:** 7 (Moderate)

**Mana Cost:** 1  
**Action Speed:** Swift

**Range:** 3m  
**Target:** One creature  
**Duration:** Instant or 5 minutes (concentration)  
**Resist:** Willpower

Allows you to speak a message (one or two sentences) telepathically into the mind of another creature. You may choose to allow them to respond. At any point the creature you communicate with may resist to not hear what you say to them (and end the spell), or resist to force you to listen to them. In any case, you may choose to allow a single message back and forth, or concentrate to allow for a longer conversation. Any communications made are done so without requiring a specific language; the intent of the message is translated into a language the receiver can always understand.

## Minor Illusion

**Specializations:** Arcane, Authority, Conjuration, Darkness  
**Difficulty:** 7 (Moderate)

**Mana Cost:** 1  
**Action Speed:** Swift

**Range:** Touch  
**Duration:** Indefinite (concentration, range of 30m)

You create the illusion of a small object, very tiny creature, or various small magical effects (like sparks or flashes of light). This effect originates from a short distance nearby (usually within or near your hands). This effect can be made to interact with any of the senses, and as such can be felt to have a solid form and real weight.

## Seek Guidance

**Specializations:** Augury, Authority, Balance, Service (Bonus: Adept), Entropy, Harmony, Light  
**Difficulty:** 10 (Hard)

**Mana Cost:** 2  
**Action Speed:** Extended (1 minute)

Provides you with some information about any subject. Ask the Game Master a simple question (no longer than one sentence). You must ask this question from the perspective of your character.

***Critical:*** Receive a three word clue or a yes-or-no answer (Game Master's choice).  
***Success:*** Receive a two word clue.  
***Graze:*** Receive a one word clue.

## Shield

**Specializations:** Arcane, Conjuration, Enchantment, Militarism, Shouki  
**Difficulty:** 10 (Hard)

**Mana Cost:** 2  
**Action Speed:** Reaction

**Target:** Self  
**Duration:** Instant or 5 minutes (concentration)

You create a magical shield. It acts like a shield in that it has a block value, but it has no weight or strength requirements. Additionally, this shield is capable of reducing magical damage unlike real shields. This spell can be cast in a moment to block an incoming attack or spell, or it can be maintained with concentration. If it is maintained, it is as though it is attached to your hand or wrist, but it does not require that your hand is empty. As long as it is maintained you may block with it as normal, and you may spend mana or stamina when doing so.

***Critical:*** Block 6.  
***Success:*** Block 5.  
***Graze:*** Block 4.

## Sickness

**Specializations:** Conjuration, Earth, Militarism, Transmutation, Water  
**Difficulty:** 10 (Hard)

**Mana Cost:** 2  
**Action Speed:** Standard

**Range:** 10m  
**Target:** One creature  
**Duration:** 1 week  
**Resist:** Fortitude

Inflict sickness upon a creature, causing it to perform tasks worse and suffer loss of health from long-term exposure. Whenever the duration is met, the target may make a fortitude check to reduce their sickness by 1.

***Critical:*** The target gets sickness 2.  
***Graze/Success:*** The target gets sickness 1.

## Sight

**Specializations:** Augury, Authority, Balance, Discipline, Enchantment, Light, Shouki  
**Difficulty:** 7 (Moderate)

**Mana Cost:** 1  
**Action Speed:** Swift

**Range:** Touch  
**Target:** One creature  
**Duration:** Indefinite (concentration, range of 30m)  
**Resist:** Willpower

Allows a creature to see, even if they are naturally blind, in any amount of light or darkness as though they could see with normal daylight vision. The sight of the target adjusts naturally to any degree of light or darkness.

## Sight Projection

**Specializations:** Augury, Authority, Light, Shouki  
**Difficulty:** 10 (Hard)

**Mana Cost:** 2  
**Action Speed:** Standard

**Target:** Self  
**Duration:** 30 minutes (concentration, range of 100m+)

You project your sight as though it is coming from another body. This effect begins where your body is, but can be moved around like a floating camera at a speed of 6m. You can move your body independantly but it will be very difficult if you cannot see your body at the same time. This projection cannot pass through solid objects, but can pass through very tiny openings. This projection can be seen by those under the effect of the Sight spell, and appears as a tiny floating glowing eye. The maximum range of this spell increases by 25m for every 1 your casting roll bypasses the difficulty.

## Sleep

**Specializations:** Authority, Darkness, Enchantment, Evocation  
**Difficulty:** 14 (Challenging)

**Mana Cost:** 3  
**Action Speed:** Full-round

**Range:** 10m  
**Target:** One or more creatures  
**Duration:** 30 minutes or 1 minute (for combatants)  
**Resist:** Willpower

The targets succumb to a magical sleep. When cast on unsuspecting creatures they enter a deep sleep for duration of 30 minutes (long enough to count as a short rest). It is quite hard to wake creatures under this sleep unless they are attacked or dealt damage.

When cast on creatures in combat the active adrenaline in their body makes the sleep much more temporary, and only lasts for 1 minute. Additionally, every round they get a chance to resist and wake from the sleep at the start of their turn (except for their first turn while asleep). Attacking or dealing damage will automatically wake these creatures.

Creatures fall prone when they fall asleep. This spell's mana cost and difficulty increases by 2 for each additional creature you target.

## Speak with Animals

**Specializations:** Animism (Bonus: Trained)  
**Difficulty:** 7 (Moderate)

**Mana Cost:** 1  
**Action Speed:** Standard

**Target:** Self  
**Duration:** Indefinite (concentration)

You gain the ability to properly communicate with animals. This provides advantage to wild empathy checks, and allows you to speak to animals receiving a response you can understand. While you are capable of articulating more advanced concepts, the animal is less capable. Most responses received will be either in very simple sentences or as an emotion. You may still require their trust before you receive a truthful response. Attempts to articulate complex concepts beyond the scope of a wild animal will be completely misunderstood.

## Suggestion

**Specializations:** Authority, Enchantment, Evocation, Fire  
**Difficulty:** 10 (Hard)

**Mana Cost:** 2  
**Action Speed:** Swift

**Range:** 10m  
**Target:** One creature  
**Duration:** 1 hour (until request met)  
**Resist:** Willpower

You make a simple request of a creature (no longer than two sentences). If that creature can understand what you are saying, and the request does not cause harm to that creature or its allies, it must do as you ask. Even if the creature resists this spell, they will not be aware that the suggestion was magical.

## Telekinesis

**Specializations:** Air, Arcane, Kiai, Transmutation  
**Difficulty:** 7 (Moderate)

**Mana Cost:** 1  
**Action Speed:** Swift

**Range:** 3m  
**Target:** One object or creature  
**Duration:** Instant or 5 minutes (concentration, range)  
**Resist:** Willpower

You can manipulate any object or creature as you could manually with your hands, but from a distance. This includes moving objects, opening doors, and even moving and making attacks with melee weapons from a distance (subject to all normal attack rules). If you attempt anything that would require the use of your strength, such as attack damage, or an athletics check, use your spellcasting stat instead of your strength. Any objects can only move a total distance equal to twice the range of this spell, per turn, unless they are thrown (and released from your telekinesis). Concentrating on this spell allows you to manipulate an object continuously.

## Water Breathing

**Specializations:** Air, Enchantment, Shouki, Transmutation, Water  
**Difficulty:** 10 (Hard)

**Mana Cost:** 2  
**Action Speed:** Standard

**Range:** 10m  
**Target:** One or more creatures or objects  
**Duration:** 30 minutes (concentration)  
**Resist:** Willpower

Allows the targets to breath underwater the same as they breath air above water, by providing them with magical gills. This does not prevent them from breathing air. This spell's mana cost and difficulty increase by 1 for each additional creature that you target.

## Water Jet

**Specializations:** Conjuration, Water  
**Difficulty:** 7 (Moderate)

**Mana Cost:** 1  
**Action Speed:** Swift

**Range:** 3m  
**Target:** One creature, object, or point  
**Resist:** Evasion or Fortitude

Soaks a target in water and optionally knocks the target back a distance up to 3m, by generating a stream of water from your body. Can be used from a source of water instead of your body thus allowing you to project a stream with twice the range and knockback, but costs 1 more mana and with 2 higher difficulty. This spell can also be used to stop objects or creatures from burning by soaking them in water. When used on grease or oil, however, it will instead increase the radius by 1m and not stop any burning.
