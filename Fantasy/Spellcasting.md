# Spellcasting

There are several different ways to cast spells, as represented by these skills: *animism*, *arcana*, *faith*, *ki*, and *power*. Each skill represents a different method and motivation for casting spells. When you become trained in one of these skills, you also will pick a specialization of that skill. Unless otherwise stated, whenever you advance in a spellcasting skill, you will learn a new spell to learn with that skill. Similarly, when your character starts with a spellcasting skill, they start with spells known in the same way based on your advancement. The highest difficulty spell you can learn is determined by the dice step you are advancing to.

##### Table: Spell Learning Difficulty Limits
| Dice Step | Step Name | Highest Difficulty |
|:-:|:-|:-|
| 1d4 | Trained | 7 (Moderate) |
| 1d6 | Adept | 7 (Moderate) |
| 1d8 | Practiced | 10 (Hard) |
| 1d10 | Proficient | 10 (Hard) |
| 1d12 | Exceptional | 14 (Challenging) |
| 1d10+1d4 | Disciplined | 14 (Challenging) |
| 1d10+1d6 | Accomplished | 19 (Ambitious) |
| 1d10+1d8 | Expert | 19 (Ambitious) |
| 2d10 | Master | 19 (Ambitious) |

To cast a spell you must perform the following steps:

1. Roll your spellcasting skill and associated stat versus the spell's difficulty.
2. If you succeed, spend mana equal to that spell's cost. If you fail, spend 1 mana instead.
3. Perform the effects of that spell based on your degree of success.
4. The targets (if any) may roll to resist the effects of that spell (if allowed).

If the targets of your spells choose to resist them, they roll their stat to resist as specified by that spell. Unless a spell states otherwise, resisting a spell negates all effects of that spell on that target. When a target rolls to resist that spell, they are rolling an opposed check against the roll you already made to cast that spell.

Whenever a spell refers to your *spellcasting stat* it means the stat that your spellcasting skill is associated with.

You may choose to downgrade how well you cast a spell if you want to cast a lesser version instead.

# Spells

Even though many different spellcasting skills have different methods and motivations, they may cast some similar spells. Spells will have listed specializations of a spellcasting skill required to learn those spells. Most spells can be used by at least a couple specializations.

Spells may deal various types of *magical damage*. By default, all magical damage bypasses damage reduction, unless the spell is blocked. Magical damage types are anything that is not specifically listed as physical damage (blunt, piercing, and slashing). The types of magical damage are: *arcane*, *cold*, *electric*, and *fire*.

Some spells will have a listed duration with the word *concentration* or some other condition listed. This means that the spell will last either until the duration is met, or the condition is fulfilled. Spells requiring concentration last as long as you decide to maintain concentration on that spell or until the duration is exceeded. You may only concentrate on a single spell requiring it any given time. If any other condition is listed, then the spell ends as soon as that condition is met.

Additional spells cast during the same turn get a â€“2 penalty to cast for each spell cast before it in the same turn. This penalty applies to all forms of spells cast. This is known as the *multiple spell penalty*. Spells cast as a reaction are considered spells cast on your next turn (such as by a readied action).

If you attempt anything that would require the use of your strength, such as attack damage, or an athletics check, use your spellcasting stat instead of your strength. Any objects moved can only move a total of 6m at once, unless they are thrown (and released from your telekinesis). Concentrating on this spell allows you to manipulate an object continuously.
