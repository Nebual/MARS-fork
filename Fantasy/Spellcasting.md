# Spellcasting

There are several different ways to cast spells, as represented by these skills: *animism*, *arcana*, *faith*, *ki*, and *power*. Each skill represents a different method and motivation for casting spells. When you become trained in one of these skills, you also will pick a specialization of that skill. Unless otherwise stated, whenever you advance in a spellcasting skill, you will learn a new spell to learn with that skill. Similarly, when your character starts with a spellcasting skill, they start with spells known in the same way based on your advancement. The highest difficulty spell you can learn is determined by the dice step you are advancing to.

##### Table: Spell Learning Difficulty Limits
| Dice Step | Step Name | Highest Difficulty |
|:-:|:-|:-|
| 1d4 | Trained | 7 (Moderate) |
| 1d6 | Adept | 7 (Moderate) |
| 1d8 | Practiced | 10 (Hard) |
| 1d10 | Proficient | 10 (Hard) |
| 1d12 | Exceptional | 14 (Challenging) |
| 1d10+1d4 | Disciplined | 14 (Challenging) |
| 1d10+1d6 | Accomplished | 19 (Ambitious) |
| 1d10+1d8 | Expert | 19 (Ambitious) |
| 2d10 | Master | 19 (Ambitious) |

To cast a spell you must perform the following steps:

1. Roll your spellcasting skill and associated stat versus the spell's difficulty.
2. If you succeed, spend mana equal to that spell's cost. If you fail, spend 1 mana instead.
3. Perform the effects of that spell based on your degree of success.
4. The targets (if any) may roll to resist the effects of that spell (if allowed).

If the targets of your spells choose to resist them, they roll their stat to resist as specified by that spell. Unless a spell states otherwise, resisting a spell negates all effects of that spell on that target. When a target rolls to resist that spell, they are rolling an opposed check against the roll you already made to cast that spell. If the recipients of that spell are granted future opportunities to resist that spell, they will continue to roll resist checks against the same value.

Whenever a spell refers to your *spellcasting stat* it means the stat that your spellcasting skill is associated with.

You may choose to downgrade how well you cast a spell if you want to cast a lesser version instead.

# Spells

Even though many different spellcasting skills have different methods and motivations, they may cast some similar spells. Spells will have listed specializations of a spellcasting skill required to learn those spells. Most spells can be used by at least a couple specializations.

Spells may deal various types of *magical damage*. By default, all magical damage bypasses damage reduction, unless the spell is blocked. Magical damage types are anything that is not specifically listed as physical damage (blunt, piercing, and slashing). The types of magical damage are: *arcane*, *cold*, *electric*, and *fire*.

Some spells will have a listed duration with the word *concentration* or some other condition listed. This means that the spell will last either until the duration is met, or the condition is fulfilled. Spells requiring concentration last as long as you decide to maintain concentration on that spell, until the duration is exceeded, or you become unconscious. You may only concentrate on a single spell requiring it any given time. If any other condition is listed, then the spell ends as soon as that condition is met or broken. If a concentration spell ends while you are still maintaining concentration, you may spend the mana cost of that spell to renew its duration.

Additional spells cast during the same turn get a â€“2 penalty to cast for each spell cast before it in the same turn. This penalty applies to all forms of spells cast. This is known as the *multiple spell penalty*. Spells cast as a reaction are considered spells cast on your next turn (such as by a readied action).

You shoot arcane missiles dealing 1d4+1 arcane damage. These missiles always hit their targets, but may be resisted for half damage (rounded up).

**Action Speed:** Standard

**Duration:** 5 minutes (concentration)  
**Resist:** Willpower

You create a suit of magical armour on the target of your spell. It has an armour class and damage reduction similar to armour, but it has no weight or strength requirements. Additionally, this armour is capable of reducing magical damage unlike real armour. If a character wearing the arcane armour is also wearing real body armour, use whatever values are higher between the arcane and real armour. Even so, arcane armour will always remove any weaknesses that the real armour would have had, and still provides the ability to reduce damage from magic. It does not remove any other features of the real armour (such as the weight, strength requirement, or any noise it might produce).

***Critical:*** 5 armour class and 7 damage reduction.  
***Success:*** 3 armour class and 5 damage reduction.  
***Graze:*** 2 armour class and 3 damage reduction.

Allows you to read the active thoughts of another creature without them knowing you are doing so.

***Critical:*** Allows you to read deep thoughts without alerting the target to your presence.

You lay your hand upon another creature, providing it comfort and a feeling of greater confidence. They get an advantage to the next skill check they perform. You may cast this spell at a range by speaking inspiring words, but the spell will cost 3 mana instead.

**Resist:** Willpower

You touch an object or surface, causing it to radiate light like a torch in a 10m radius. In daylight or a well lit area the magical light is unnoticeable.

**Action Speed:** Standard

**Range:** Touch

Allows you to speak a message (one or two sentences) telepathically into the mind of another creature. You may choose to allow them to respond. At any point the creature you communicate with may resist to not hear what you say to them (and end the spell), or resist to force you to listen to them. In any case, you may choose to allow a single message back and forth, or concentrate to allow for a longer conversation. Any communications made are done so without requiring a specific language; the intent of the message is translated into a language the receiver can always understand.

## Minor Illusion

**Specializations:** Conjuration  
**Difficulty:** 7 (Moderate)

**Mana Cost:** 1  
**Action Speed:** Swift

**Range:** Touch  
**Duration:** Indefinite (concentration, range of 30m)

You create the illusion of a small object, tiny creature, or various small magical effects (like sparks or flashes of light).

**Difficulty:** 10 (Hard)

**Action Speed:** Reaction

**Range:** Self  
**Duration:** Instant or 5 minutes (concentration)

You create a magical shield. It acts like a shield in that is has a block value, but it has no weight or strength requirements. This spell can be cast in a moment to block an incoming attack or spell, or it can be maintained with concentration. If it is maintained, it is as though it is attached to your hand or wrist, but it does not require that your hand is empty. As long as it is maintained you may block with it as normal, and you may spend mana instead of stamina when doing so. If this spell is cast to block as a reaction but then not maintained, it costs only 1 mana instead of 2.

***Critical:*** Block 5.  
***Success:*** Block 4.  
***Graze:*** Block 3.

## Sickness

## Suggestion

**Specializations:** Enchantment, Evocation  
**Difficulty:** 10 (Hard)

**Mana Cost:** 2  
**Action Speed:** Swift

**Range:** 10m  
**Target:** One creature  
**Duration:** 1 hour (until request met)  
**Resist:** Willpower

You make a simple request of a creature (no longer than two sentences).

Even if the creature resists this spell, they will not be aware that the suggestion was magical.

## Telekinesis

**Specializations:** Transmutation  
**Difficulty:** 7 (Moderate)

**Mana Cost:** 1  
**Action Speed:** Swift

**Range:** 3m  
**Target:** One object or creature  
**Duration:** Instant or 5 minutes (concentration, range)  
**Resist:** Willpower

You can manipulate any object or creature as you could manually with your hands, but from a distance. This includes moving objects, opening doors, and even moving and making attacks with melee weapons from a distance (subject to all normal attack rules). If you attempt anything that would require the use of your strength, such as attack damage, or an athletics check, use your spellcasting stat instead of your strength. Any objects moved can only move a total of 6m at once, unless they are thrown (and released from your telekinesis). Concentrating on this spell allows you to manipulate an object continuously.
