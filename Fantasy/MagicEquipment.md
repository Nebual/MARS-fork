In most marketplaces, normal items of most varieties can be purchased. Magic equipment is much more difficult to acquire. Outside of wealthy cities, magic items are very rare to find, and rarer still to be available for purchase. Even in wealthy cities, some magic items might not be available. Very expensive magical items (with a magic effect valuing more than 100sp) or items requiring someone exceptionally skilled, will require the use of the [craft skill](/Fantasy/Skills.md#craft-int).

Activating any spell effect without the use of a spellstone does not count as casting a spell.

## Attunement

Some magic items require that they be attuned to before providing their effects. This functions similarly to the maintenance of concentration. Anyone can attune to a magic item, but they can only attune to one item at a time. Once an item is attuned to it is essentially turned on. Attuning to an item does not require any skills or spellcasting ability, but it does take a short amount of time equivalent to a swift action. If the item requires you to attune to it as a part of casting a spell, the attunement does not require the use of an additional swift action. Deattuning to an item, to turn it off, can be done as a free action.

Magic items listed note if they require attunement. For custom crafted magic items, you can tell if it requires attunement if the spell used to craft it requires concentration. This is true with one exception: potions never require attunement. Any magical effects they provide last for the maximum duration that the spell can last.

## Potions

Potions are single use items that provide a magic effect when consumed. They can be used personally or applied to another character or object. Normally this requires the other character to be either willing or unconscious. Alternatively, you can throw the potion at a target as an improvised ranged weapon, which causes its effects to occur upon impact. When consumed or thrown it is used as a swift action, when poured out onto the ground or an object, it takes a standard action.

When a potion applies the effects of a spell, it applies it at a fixed spellcasting roll. This is done instead of rolling a spellcasting skill for that spell effect, as the effect is guaranteed and no spell is actually cast. This is true even for potions that are thrown to inflict their effects.

All potions have the same weight: Â½kg.

##### Table: Potions

## Refilling Potions

Some potions are capable of automatically refilling. These potions are usuable once a day. If thrown to cause their effect, they are destroyed the same as normal potions.

##### Table: Refilling Potions
| Name | Price | Spell | Spellcasting<br/>Roll |

| Refilling Potion of Water Breathing | 41sp | [Water Breathing](/Fantasy/Spells.md#water-breathing) | 10 (Success) |

## Scrolls

While not technically a magic item, scrolls do contain information for casting magic spells. Scrolls are limited only to spells available to the [arcana skill](/Fantasy/Skills.md#arcana-int), as it only provides them a benefit. The cost of a scroll depends on the mana cost and difficulty to cast a spell. All spells that share these values will cost the same amount to buy.

##### Table: Scrolls Cost
| Mana<br/>Cost | Spellcasting<br/>Difficulty | Price |
|:-|:-:|:-:|
| 1 | 7 | 7sp |
| 2 | 10 | 20sp |
| 3 | 14 | 42sp |
| 4 | 19 | 76sp |

## Spellstones

Spellstones hold one or more uses of a single spell, and can be activated to cast spells stored in them. This activation requires the same amount of time that it would take to normally cast that spell, and can be done even if the user could not normally cast it. They can also be thrown as improvised weapons, like potions, to cause their effect on impact. Using them in this way does not count as casting a spell. If thrown to cause their effect, they are destroyed in the process.

Spellstones (unlike potions) actually require the spells inside them to be cast and are not given automatic spellcasting rolls. Instead they are given an automatic minimum. When used, the user of the spellstone makes an appropriate spellcasting roll if possible. If they do not have a skill capable of casting that spell, then they instead roll their intelligence or resolve (whichever they want). Even if the user does not have the spell learned, they may still use the appropriate skill (one where it is learnable). Then, if the roll made is less than that spellstone's automatic minimum for that spell (including bonuses), their roll gets upgraded to the minimum. If the spell effect is caused by the destruction of the spellstone (such as from throwing it), it is given an automatic roll equal to twice the minimum roll.

Spellstones are typically crafted with one of two primary uses in mind: to always guarantee at least some degree of success, or to always prevent spell failure. Spellstones that have a limited number of uses are typically used by non-spellcasters who want access to spell effects. These are cheaper to create and are usually good enough to guarantee a grazing success.

##### Table: Spellstones (Limited Uses)
| Name | Price | Spell | Spellcasting<br/>Minimum | Attunement |
|:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Spellstone of Electricity (5 uses) | 16sp | [Jolt](/Fantasy/Spells.md#jolt) | 7 (Success) | No |
| Spellstone of Ignition (5 uses) | 16sp | [Ignite](/Fantasy/Spells.md#ignite) | 7 (Success) | No |
| Spellstone of Light (5 uses) | 16sp | [Light](/Fantasy/Spells.md#light) | 7 (GSuccess) | Yes |
| Spellstone of Mending (5 uses) | 42sp | [Mending](/Fantasy/Spells.md#mending) | 10 (Success) | No |
| Spellstone of Telekinesis (5 uses) | 16sp | [Telekinesis](/Fantasy/Spells.md#telekinesis) | 7 (Success) | Optional |

Spellstones that are reusable (providing daily uses) are typically used by trained spellcasters, as they usually only safeguard against spellcasting fumbles.

##### Table: Spellstones (Per Day)
| Name | Price | Spell | Spellcasting<br/>Minimum | Attunement |
|:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Spellstone of Electricity (1/day) | 18sp | [Jolt](/Fantasy/Spells.md#jolt) | 4 (Graze) | No |
| Spellstone of Ignition (1/day) | 18sp | [Ignite](/Fantasy/Spells.md#ignite) | 4 (Graze) | No |
| Spellstone of Knock (1/day) | 98sp | [Knock](/Fantasy/Spells.md#knock) | 8 (Graze) | No |
| Spellstone of Light (1/day) | 18sp | [Light](/Fantasy/Spells.md#light) | 4 (Graze) | Yes |
| Spellstone of Mending (1/day) | 50sp | [Mending](/Fantasy/Spells.md#mending) | 6 (Graze) | No |
| Spellstone of Telekinesis (1/day) | 18sp | [Telekinesis](/Fantasy/Spells.md#telekinesis) | 4 (Graze) | Optional |

Spellstones can also be socketed into another item (such as a ring or staff), allowing you to use that item to cast spells from the spellstone. Unfortunately, spellstones socketed into items conflict with other spellstones and other magic effects on the same item. This renders all of these items and effects unusable until the conflict is resolved, or *all* of the items are [magically stabilized](/Fantasy/ItemCrafting.md#magic-stabilization) by someone with the craft skill, allowing them to work together.

## Spellstone Qualities

Spellstones can be made of gemstones ranging several degrees of quality. The quality of the gemstone provides a bonus to spellcasting rolls made to cast spells contained within them. By default, the prices of spellstones are listed as though they are made from rough gemstones (the lowest quality), which provide no bonus to spellcasting rolls. Spellstones may be bought at higher quality and a higher cost. Below is a table that shows the increase in cost and the spellcasting bonus each quality provides:

##### Table: Spellstone Qualities & Spellcasting Bonuses
| Name | Price<br/>Increase | Spellcasting<br/>Bonus |
|:-|:-:|:-:|
| Gemstone, fine | 8sp | +1 |
| Gemstone, exceptional | 48sp | +2 |
| Gemstone, magnificent | 98sp | +3 |

## Magic Weapons

Magic weapons require attunement to provide their effects, and may do so continuously. They deal half magical damage of a specified element. This causes them to ignore half of the damage reduction from the attack target's armour. They also provide an additional effect when they perform a critical strike (as listed on the spell [magic weapon](/Fantasy/Spells.md#magic-weapon)).

All magic weapons cost exactly 100sp more than their base item counterpart. Any weapon is capable of being a magic weapon (with any elemental effect), and not just those limited to the following table:

##### Table: Magic Weapons
| Name | Base Item | Price | Spell |
|:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Arcane Crossbow | Crossbow | 116sp | [Magic Weapon (arcane)](/Fantasy/Spells.md#magic-weapon) |
| Chilling Battleaxe | Battleaxe | 108sp | [Magic Weapon (cold)](/Fantasy/Spells.md#magic-weapon) |
| Flaming Longsword | Longsword | 108sp | [Magic Weapon (fire)](/Fantasy/Spells.md#magic-weapon) |
| Lightning Warhammer | Warhammer | 108sp | [Magic Weapon (electric)](/Fantasy/Spells.md#magic-weapon) |
| Necrotic Dagger | Dagger | 105sp | [Magic Weapon (void)](/Fantasy/Spells.md#magic-weapon) |
| Radiant Warstaff | Warstaff | 108sp | [Magic Weapon (radiant)](/Fantasy/Spells.md#magic-weapon) |

## Magic Armour

Magic armour requires attunement to provide their effects, and may do so continuously. Magical armour allows you to use your damage reduction to prevent magic damage. The armour still retains all of its other features.

All magic armour costs exactly 100sp more than their base item counterpart. Only body armour can be enchanted with this effect.

## Magic Gear

Most magic gear requires attunement to provide their effects, and may do so continuously. Magic gear can be made out of any other wearable item such as boots, belts, gloves, hats, cloaks, etc. Not all magic gear needs to be worn, some are held in the hand. Magic gear that provide a continuous effect do so at a fixed effectiveness, similar to potions. This effectiveness is typically equal to a what a normal success would be if that spell was cast.

##### Table: Magic Gear
| Name | Base Item | Price | Spell |
|:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Cloak of Feather Fall | Cloak | 37sp | [Feather Fall](/Fantasy/Spells.md#feather-fall) |
| Gloves of Telekinesis | Gloves | 35sp 5cp | [Telekinesis](/Fantasy/Spells.md#telekinesis) |
| Mask of Water Breathing | Mask | 101sp | [Water Breathing](/Fantasy/Spells.md#water-breathing) |
| Spectacles of Sight | Glasses | 37sp | [Sight](/Fantasy/Spells.md#sight) |
| Sunrod | Small Iron Rod (1kg) | 36sp | [Light](/Fantasy/Spells.md#light) |
