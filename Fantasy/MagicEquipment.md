Normal equipment has a wide availability. In most marketplaces most goods can be purchased. Magic equipment is much more difficult to acquire. Outside of wealthy cities magic items are very rare to find or even purchase. Even in wealthy cities, certain magic items might not even be available. More expensive magical items (with a magic effect valuing more than 100sp) will require the use of [the craft skill](/Fantasy/Skills.md#craft-int).

All magic items are created by applying spells to items in various forms. Each magic item listed will have the spell used to create that item and the effective spellcasting roll that spell is applied at (if it is relevant).

## Attunement

Some magic items require that they be attuned to before providing their effects. This functions similarly to the maintenance of concentration. Anyone can attune to a magic item, but they can only attune to one item at a time. Once an item is attuned to it is essentially turned on. Attuning to an item does not require any skills or spellcasting ability, but it does take a short amount of time equivalent to a swift action. Deattuning to an item, to turn it off, can be done as a free action.

Magic items listed below will note if they require attunement. For custom crafted magic items, you can tell if it requires attunement if the spell used to craft it requires concentration. This is true with one exception: potions never require attunement. Any magical effects they provide last for the maximum duration that the spell can last.

## Potions

Potions are single use items that provide a magic effect when consumed. They can be both used personally or applied to another character or object. Normally this requires the other character to be either willing or unconscious. Alternatively, you can throw the potion at a target as an improvised ranged weapon, which causes its effects to occur upon impact. When consumed or thrown it is used as a swift action, when poured out onto the ground or an object, it takes a standard action.

All potions have the same weight: Â½kg.

## Spellstones

Spellstones hold one or more uses of a single spell, and can be activated to cast spells stored in them. This activation requires the same amount of time that it would take to normally cast that spell, and can be done even if the user could not normally cast it. They can also be thrown as improvised weapons, like potions, to cause their effect on impact. If thrown to cause their effect, they are destroyed in the process.

Spellstones can also be socketed into another item (such as a ring), allowing that item to cast spells from the spellstone. Unfortunately, spellstones socketed into items conflict with other spellstones and other magic effects on the same item. This renders all of these items unusable until the conflict is resolved, or all of the items are [magically stabilized](/Fantasy/ItemCrafting.md#magic-stabilization) by someone with the craft skill, allowing them to work together.

## Magic Weapons

Magic weapons require attunement to provide their effects, and may do so continuously. They deal half magical damage of a specified element. This causes them to ignore half of the damage reduction from armour. They also provide an additional effect when they perform a critical strike.

All magic weapons cost exactly 100sp more than their base item counterpart. Any weapon could be a magic weapon with any elemental effect and not just those limited to the following table:

##### Table: Magic Weapons
| Name | Base Item | Price | Spell |
|:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Arcane Crossbow | Crossbow | 116sp | [Magic Weapon (Arcane)](/Fantasy/Spellcasting.md#magic-weapon) |
| Chilling Dagger | Dagger | 105sp | [Magic Weapon (Cold)](/Fantasy/Spellcasting.md#magic-weapon) |
| Flaming Longsword | Longsword | 108sp | [Magic Weapon (Fire)](/Fantasy/Spellcasting.md#magic-weapon) |
| Lightning Warhammer | Warhammer | 108sp | [Magic Weapon (Electric)](/Fantasy/Spellcasting.md#magic-weapon) |

## Magic Armour

Magic armour requires attunement to provide their effects, and may do so continuously. Magical armour allows you to use your damage reduction to prevent magic damage. The armour still retains all of its other features.

All magic armour costs exactly 100sp more than their base item counterpart. Only body armour can be enchanted with this effect.

## Magic Gear

Most magic gear requires attunement to provide their effects, and may do so continuously. Magic gear can be made out of any other wearable item such as boots, belts, gloves, hats, cloaks, etc. Not all magic gear needs to be worn, some are held in the hand.

| Name | Base Item | Price | Spell |
|:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Cloak of Feather Fall | Cloak | 36sp | [Feather Fall](/Fantasy/Spellcasting.md#feather-fall) |
| Gloves of Telekinesis | Gloves | 36sp | [Telekinesis](/Fantasy/Spellcasting.md#telekinesis) |

| Spectacles of Sight | Glasses | 36sp | [Sight](/Fantasy/Spellcasting.md#sight) |
| Sunrod | Small Steel Rod | 36sp | [Light](/Fantasy/Spellcasting.md#light) |

Magic gear that provides usable effects are just normal objects with spellstones socketed into them. Items of this variety may or may not require attunement. For example:

| Name | Base Item | Spellstone | Price | Spell | Spellcasting<br/>Roll | Attunement |
|:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
