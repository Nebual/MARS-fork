# Equipment

## Currency

There are various types of currency that represent the money your character needs to spend on items and goods. The denominations of this currency are determined by their material. These materials are *copper*, *silver*, *electrum*, and *gold*. Each type of coin is worth ten times as much as the last.

##### Table: Currency
| Currency | Equivalent |
|:-|:-|
| 1 Silver (sp) | 10 Copper (cp) |
| 1 Electrum (ep) | 10 Silver (sp) |
| 1 Gold (gp) | 10 Electrum (ep) |

These denominations exist to add more flavour to roleplaying, as most prices of any items are determined simply by their value in silver. Sometimes copper is used for very cheap items, or as a partial amount of silver.

### Weapon Features

**Backswing** If you miss with this weapon, your next attack with it on the same target gets a +2 bonus to hit (in addition to the multiple attack penalty). This bonus does not stack.

**Bypass** Attacks made reduce the defender’s armour class by the given value during that attack.

**Cleave** Additional attacks made against new targets don’t suffer from the multiple attack penalty.

**Large** This weapon is treated as being unfit at 1m, but also is too large to make attacks at all next to walls, ceilings, or obstacles within 1m. If used within a 1m range of friendly characters you have a chance to hit them instead if you miss your target (roll an attack to hit your ally).

**Mechanical** This weapon does not add strength to damage, and can be preloaded before attacking with it.

**Mode** This weapon can make attacks with a different damage type (as listed), but with –1 to hit when doing so.

**Momentum** If you hit with this weapon, your next attack with it on the same target gets +2 to damage. This bonus stacks until the beginning of your next turn.

**Nonlethal** Enemies knocked unconscious by this weapon do not start dying unless severely injured (brought to negative ten health).

**Parry** When you use this item to perform a parry action, add the given value to your Deflection.

**Range** Attacks made work normally up to the first given range. Attacks beyond that range get –1 to hit for each additional multiple of that range between you and the target. Attacks can only be made up to a maximum of the second given range. If only one range paramter is given, then that is also the maximum range.

**Reach** Functions like ranged, but it is considered melee instead of ranged.

**Reload** Attacks can only be made by first taking the time to reload the weapon. Reloading the weapon in this way requires the use of both hands. Unless otherwise specified, it takes a swift action to reload the weapon, or a standard action if it is two-handed.

**Swift** Additional attacks made with this weapon have their multiple attack penalty reduced by half to –2 and –4 (from –4 and –8).

**Thrown** Attacks can be made as if they were ranged, but they then must be retrieved after use.

**Trip** Attacks can be made with –2 to hit to attempt to trip the target. Successful trip attempts deal half damage and cause the target to drop prone.

**Two-Handed** Attacks may be made two-handed with an advantage to damage. Attacks made single-handed get –1 to hit, and a disadvantage to damage. Two-Handed ranged weapons cannot make attacks with one hand.

**Unfit** Attacks made at the given range or closer get –2 to hit.

**Versatile** Attacks may be made two-handed with an advantage to damage and –2 to hit. Attacks made single-handed are made normally.

### Additional Rules

* Any object can be used as an improvised weapon. The type of the weapon is whichever is most similar to the object being used, but has –1 to hit and damage.
* Any object or melee weapon can be thrown as if it has *Thrown 2m/20m*.
