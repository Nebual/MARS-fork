# Artifact Equipment

* [Minor Artifacts](#minor-artifacts)
* [Major Artifacts](#major-artifacts)

Artifacts are essentially powerful magic items. What separates them from normal magic items is their cost and complexity. Magic items powerful enough to be considered artifacts are simply not available for purchase because either most craftsmen do not have the means or anyone who does keeps to themselves. Artifacts come in two categories: *minor* and *major*.

Minor artifacts follow all the normal rules of magic item creation, and as such can be crafted by players. Major artifacts possess means beyond these rules and simply cannot be crafted. This also means that major artifacts cannot be modified in any way.

## Minor Artifacts

| Name | Base Item | Price |
|:-|:-:|:-:|
| [Belt of Giant's Might](#belt-of-giants-might) | Belt | 585sp 5cp |
| [Scrying Orb](#scrying-orb) | Crystal Ball | 255sp |
| [Staff of the Magi](#staff-of-the-magi) | Fine Staff | 642sp |
| [Thundergod's Warhammer](#thungergods-warhammer) | Masterwork Heavy Warhammer | 665sp 5cp |

### Belt of Giant's Might

**Base Item:** Belt  
**Price:** 585sp 5cp

This is a wide leather belt with a crest on its clasp depicting a humanoid with strong arms. This belt causes its wearer to empowered in both strength and size. 

Attuning to this item provides an advantage to all strength rolls (from the spell [enhance (strength)](/Fantasy/Spellcasting.md#enhance)), and an increase of two size categories (from the spell [alter size](/Fantasy/Spellcasting.md#alter-size)). This size change provides a +2 bonus to strength and a -1 penalty to dexterity.

### Scrying Orb

**Base Item:** Crystal Ball  
**Price:** 255sp

This is a palm silvered glass ball capable of casting several spells via a fine spellstone embedded deep within it, which cannot be removed or modified without destroying crystal ball.

The following spells can each be used 1 time per day, with a +1 bonus to their rolls:

| Spell | Spellcasting<br/>Minimum | Attunement |
|:-|:-:|:-:|
| Seek Guidance | 10 (Graze) | No |
| Sight Projection | 10 (Graze) | Yes |

### Staff of the Magi

**Base Item:** Fine Staff  
**Price:** 642sp

This staff is capable of casting several spells via a charged bonded exceptional spellstone socketed in it, which can be removed or replaced. The spellstone in this item does not protect from fumbling spellcasting attempts, so the use of this staff by non-spellcasters can result in serious spell failure.

The following spells can be used collectively 5 times per day, with a +2 bonus to their rolls:

| Spell | Spellcasting<br/>Minimum | Attunement |
|:-|:-:|:-:|
| Ignite | 3 (Fumble) | No |
| Knock | 7 (Fumble) | No |
| Light | 3 (Fumble) | Yes |
| Mend | 5 (Fumble) | No |
| Telekinesis | 3 (Fumble) | Optional |

### Thundergod's Warhammer

**Base Item:** Masterwork Heavy Warhammer  
**Price:** 665sp 5cp

This is a masterwork heavy warhammer with a large head and a short handle. Carved into it are glowing runic symbols. Those who do not possess enough physical strength perceive this item as having an impossibly heavy weight and cannot lift it. While attuned this item crackles with lightning and appears to weigh as little as a feather.

Attuning to this item provides it the effect of electric magic damage (from the spell [magic weapon (electric)](/Fantasy/Spellcasting.md#magic-weapon)), and its user the spell effect of [feather fall](/Fantasy/Spellcasting.md#feather-fall). Additionally, the item can be thrown as if it has the feature *thrown 4m/40m* (from the spell [feather fall](/Fantasy/Spellcasting.md#feather-fall)). If thrown, it can be returned by the spell effect of [reaching](/Fantasy/Talents.md#metamagic) [telekinesis](/Fantasy/Spellcasting.md#telekinesis) as long as the weapon is within 6m of its user. The combination of these two effects allows it to make ranged attacks a combined thrown and return distance of up to 12m (within a radius of 6m) in a single turn before requiring the use of the *thrown* feature. It can even be thrown from a start position away from that of its user, as long as it is within 6m of its user.

The item is under a [limitation curse](/Fantasy/ItemCrafting.md#curses) that only allows those with a maximum strength of 16 or greater to lift and attune to the item.

## Major Artifacts

| Name | Base Item |
|:-|:-:|
| [Replicating Ring](#replicating-ring) | Gold Ring |

### Replicating Ring

**Base Item:** Gold Ring

At first glance this item appears to be a normal gold ring, but upon close inspection it shines in an almost unnatural way.

While this item is attuned, once every seven days a single piece of gold drips from it.
