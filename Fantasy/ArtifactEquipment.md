# Artifact Equipment

* [Minor Artifacts](#minor-artifacts)
* [Major Artifacts](#major-artifacts)

Artifacts are essentially powerful magic items. What separates them from normal magic items is their cost and complexity. Magic items powerful enough to be considered artifacts are simply not available for purchase because either most craftsmen do not have the means or anyone who does keeps to themselves. Artifacts come in two categories: *minor* and *major*.

## Minor Artifacts

Minor artifacts follow all the normal rules of magic item creation, and as such can be crafted by players.

### Thundergod's Warhammer

**Materials:** Masterwork Heavy Warhammer (81sp)
**Magic Cost:** 1125sp  
**Price:** 1206sp

This is a masterwork heavy warhammer with a large head and a short handle. Carved into it are glowing runic symbols. Those who do not possess enough physical strength perceive this item as having an impossibly heavy weight and cannot lift it. While attuned this item gently crackles with lightning and appears to weigh as little as a feather.

Attuning to this item provides it the effect of electric elemental damage (from the spell [magic weapon (electric)](/Fantasy/Spells.md#magic-weapon)), and its user the spell effect of [feather fall](/Fantasy/Spells.md#feather-fall). Additionally, the item can be thrown as if it has the feature *thrown 4m/40m* (from the spell [feather fall](/Fantasy/Spells.md#feather-fall)). If thrown, it can be returned by the spell effect of [reaching](/Fantasy/Talents.md#metamagic) [telekinesis](/Fantasy/Spells.md#telekinesis). The combination of these two effects allows it to make ranged attacks a combined thrown and return distance of up to 12m (as long as it remains within 6m of its user) in a single turn before requiring the normal use of the *thrown* feature. It can even be thrown from a start position away from but within 6m of its user.

The item is under a [limitation curse](/Fantasy/ItemCrafting.md#curses) that only allows those with a maximum strength of 16 or greater to lift and attune to the item.

## Major Artifacts

Major artifacts possess means beyond these rules and simply cannot be crafted. This also means that major artifacts cannot be modified in any way.

| Name | Base Item |
|:-|:-:|
| [Replicating Ring](#replicating-ring) | Gold Ring |

### Replicating Ring

**Base Item:** Gold Ring

At first glance this item appears to be a normal gold ring, but upon close inspection it shines in an almost unnatural way.

While this item is attuned, once every seven days a single piece of gold drips from it.
