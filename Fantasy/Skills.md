## Arcana (INT)

Arcana is the educated wizard's style of spellcasting, and has five different specializations to choose from which are the five different schools of magic: *augury*, *conjuration*, *enchantment*, *evocation*, and *transmutation*.

Although you will choose a school to train in, you may cast spells from any school. However, if you cast a spell from a school you are not trained in, then you will roll only your intelligence to cast that spell. You can take this skill multiple times to advance in different schools if you want to avoid this limitation and attempt to master all schools.

Since arcana is a book-learned style of spellcasting, it only functions well if you have a book containing scrolls of known spells. Scrolls are essentially a page's worth of spellcasting information on a single spell. As a practicing and inventive wizard, you acquire a new scroll of any spell matching your school when you advance your arcana skill (this represents how you learn spells). Scrolls can also be acquired by purchasing them from other wizards (including spells that you can't yet learn directly from advancement).

Wizards are not entirely incapable if they don't have their spell books to practice from. If you attempt to cast any spell that you don't have a scroll for, that spell is cast with disadvantage. Spells can only be cast in this way if you are at least trained in that spell's school (you must understand the basics of casting those spells without assistance).

### Augury

Augurs are the types of wizards who like to know things and solve problems. Augury can be used to learn information that would otherwise be unavailable, or solve simple problems that might require the use of someone with specialized skills.

### Conjuration

Conjurors create illusions or magical tricks; they create effects that aren't real or have limited permanence. These types of effects are usually limited to things you can sense (see, hear, touch, taste, and smell).

### Enchantment

Enchanting is the process of using magic to alter how things function, or improve how they function. This type of magic can be used on both objects and people, and usually results in effects that appear obviously supernatural.

### Evocation

Evokers are normally known for one simple thing: destruction. It is true that evocation is a direct means to accessing destructive forces, but it can also be used to motivate and inspire. Evocation is really about activating deep emotions with the power of magic.

### Transmutation

Transmuters can change one thing into something else, or repair what is broken. Transmutation focuses on the alteration of physical things, and does not necessarily provide results that one would assume are of a magical nature.

## Craft (INT)

Someone must create all the items and artifacts that you use, and that someone could even be you.

The first step to crafting an item is just a matter of roleplaying: is a workshop or marketplace available, or do you carry the tools necessary to build this item? Afterwards, there are three basic steps:

* Determine total cost and craft difficulty
* Roll craft check
* Determine progress and pay immediate cost

The difficulty value to craft an item is based on its cost. This can be determined manually by finding the square root of the cost in silver pieces, then adding 4 to the result. The following table can be used as a quick reference.

##### Table: Item Cost vs Craft Difficulty
| Item Cost | Difficulty | Item Cost | Difficulty |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 1sp+ | 5 | 225sp+ | 19 |
| 4sp+ | 6 | 256sp+ | 20 |
| 9sp+ | 7 | 289sp+ | 21 |
| 16sp+ | 8 | 324sp+ | 22 |
| 25sp+ | 9 | 361sp+ | 23 |
| 36sp+ | 10 | 400sp+ | 24 |
| 49sp+ | 11 | 441sp+ | 25 |
| 64sp+ | 12 | 484sp+ | 26 |
| 81sp+ | 13 | 529sp+ | 27 |
| 100sp+ | 14 | 576sp+ | 28 |
| 121sp+ | 15 | 625sp+ | 29 |
| 144sp+ | 16 | 676sp+ | 30 |
| 169sp+ | 17 | 729sp+ | 31 |
| 196sp+ | 18 | 784sp+ | 32 |

After you have determined the item's cost and difficulty, make a craft check. Your roll determines the percentage of your crafting progress and how much you will pay immediately, representing the raw ingredients that are used up to create the item. Multiply the item's cost by the progress percentage and then adjust accordingly if you rolled a success or critical, rounding up:

***Critical:*** Gain 50% progress and pay half price.

***Success:*** Gain 20% progress and pay three quarters price.

***Graze:*** Gain 10% progress and pay full price.

***Fail:*** Gain 2% progress and pay full price.

***Fumble:*** Lose 5% progress.

If you roll three times the difficulty or higher, then you craft the whole item immediately, paying half price.

Make sure to prepare enough money to pay for the item. If you can't pay for your progress, then no progress is made.

Each craft check made represents a single day's worth of crafting time spent on that item.

> ##### Crafting Example
> ___
> **Craft:** 1d12
>
> **Intelligence:** 1d12+1
>
> **Craft Check Roll:** 2d12+1
> ___
> **Item:** Brigandine
>
> **Cost:** 40sp
>
> **Difficulty:** 10
>
> | Roll | Progress | Cost |
> |:-:|:-:|:-:|
> | 12 (Success) | +20% = 20% | 6sp |
> | 16 (Success) | +20% = 40% | 6sp |
> | 10 (Graze) | +10% = 50% | 4sp |
> | 6 (Fail) | +2% = 52% | 8cp |
> | 13 (Success) | +20% = 72% | 6sp |
> | 21 (Critical) | +28% (50%) = 100% | 5sp 6cp |
> ___
> **Time Spent:** 6 Days
>
> **Total Cost:** 28sp 4cp (71% of cost)

### Upgrading Items

Crafting can also be used to improve items from one quality to the next by treating the difference in item value as the cost of the item. Items in progress cannot be used until completed.

> ##### Upgrade Example
> ___
> **Craft:** 1d12
>
> **Intelligence:** 1d12+1
>
> **Craft Check Roll:** 2d12+1
> ___
> **Item:** Longsword to Fine Longsword
>
> **Cost:** 10sp (10sp to 20sp)
>
> **Difficulty:** 8
>
> | Roll | Progress | Cost |
> |:-:|:-:|:-:|
> | 8 (Graze) | +10% = 10% | 1sp 5cp |
> | 17 (Critical) | +50% = 60% | 3sp 8cp |
> | 11 (Success) | +20% = 80% | 2sp 3cp |
> | 19 (Critical) | +20% (50%) = 100% | 1sp 4cp |
> ___
> **Time Spent:** 4 Days
>
> **Total Cost:** 9sp (60% of cost)

You cannot upgrade into a quality with a cost reduction.

### Crafting Magical Items

Base item cost + magic cost = total cost

##### Table: Magical Item Costs
| Modifier | Cost Formula |
|:-|:-|
| Magic Cost | Mana Cost × Spell Difficulty |
| Uses per Day | Magic Cost × Uses |
| Limited Uses | Magic Cost × Uses ÷ 5 |
| Concentration<br/>For Effect<br/>(Unlimited Uses) | Magic Cost × 10 |
| Concentration<br/>For Effect<br/>(Limited Uses) | Magic Cost × Uses × 2 |
| Graze Effect | Magic Cost ÷ 2 |
| Critical Effect | Magic Cost × 2 |
