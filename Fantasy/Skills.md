## Craft (Int)

Someone must create all the items and artifacts that you use, and that someone could even be you.

The first step to crafting an item is just a matter of roleplaying: is a workshop or marketplace available, or do you carry the tools necessary to build this item? Afterwards, there are three basic steps:

* Determine total cost and craft difficulty
* Roll craft check
* Determine progress and pay immediate cost

The difficulty value to craft an item is based on its cost. This can be determined manually by finding the square root of the cost in silver pieces, then adding 4 to the result. The following table can be used as a quick reference.

##### Table: Item Cost vs Craft Difficulty
| Item Cost | Difficulty | Item Cost | Difficulty |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 1sp+ | 5 | 225sp+ | 19 |
| 4sp+ | 6 | 256sp+ | 20 |
| 9sp+ | 7 | 289sp+ | 21 |
| 16sp+ | 8 | 324sp+ | 22 |
| 25sp+ | 9 | 361sp+ | 23 |
| 36sp+ | 10 | 400sp+ | 24 |
| 49sp+ | 11 | 441sp+ | 25 |
| 64sp+ | 12 | 484sp+ | 26 |
| 81sp+ | 13 | 529sp+ | 27 |
| 100sp+ | 14 | 576sp+ | 28 |
| 121sp+ | 15 | 625sp+ | 29 |
| 144sp+ | 16 | 676sp+ | 30 |
| 169sp+ | 17 | 729sp+ | 31 |
| 196sp+ | 18 | 784sp+ | 32 |

After you have determined the item's cost and difficulty, make a craft check. Your roll determines the percentage of your crafting progress and how much you will pay immediately, representing the raw ingredients that are used up to create the item. Multiply the item's cost by the progress percentage and then adjust accordingly if you rolled a success or critical, rounding up:

***Critical:*** Gain 50% progress and pay half price.

***Success:*** Gain 20% progress and pay three quarters price.

***Graze:*** Gain 10% progress and pay full price.

***Fail:*** Gain 2% progress and pay full price.

***Fumble:*** Lose 5% progress.

If you roll three times the difficulty or higher, then you craft the whole item immediately, paying half price.

Make sure to prepare enough money to pay for the item. If you can't pay for your progress, then no progress is made.

Each craft check made represents a single day's worth of crafting time spent on that item.

> ##### Crafting Example
> ___
> **Craft:** 1d12
>
> **Intelligence:** 1d12+1
>
> **Craft Check Roll:** 2d12+1
> ___
> **Item:** Brigandine
>
> **Cost:** 40sp
>
> **Difficulty:** 10
>
> | Roll | Progress | Cost |
> |:-:|:-:|:-:|
> | 12 (Success) | +20% = 20% | 6sp |
> | 16 (Success) | +20% = 40% | 6sp |
> | 10 (Graze) | +10% = 50% | 4sp |
> | 6 (Fail) | +2% = 52% | 8cp |
> | 13 (Success) | +20% = 72% | 6sp |
> | 21 (Critical) | +28% (50%) = 100% | 5sp 6cp |
> ___
> **Time Spent:** 6 Days
>
> **Total Cost:** 28sp 4cp (71% of cost)

### Upgrading Items

Crafting can also be used to improve items from one quality to the next by treating the difference in item value as the cost of the item. Items in progress cannot be used until completed.

> ##### Upgrade Example
> ___
> **Craft:** 1d12
>
> **Intelligence:** 1d12+1
>
> **Craft Check Roll:** 2d12+1
> ___
> **Item:** Longsword to Fine Longsword
>
> **Cost:** 10sp (10sp to 20sp)
>
> **Difficulty:** 8
>
> | Roll | Progress | Cost |
> |:-:|:-:|:-:|
> | 8 (Graze) | +10% = 10% | 1sp 5cp |
> | 17 (Critical) | +50% = 60% | 3sp 8cp |
> | 11 (Success) | +20% = 80% | 2sp 3cp |
> | 19 (Critical) | +20% (50%) = 100% | 1sp 4cp |
> ___
> **Time Spent:** 4 Days
>
> **Total Cost:** 9sp (60% of cost)

You cannot upgrade into a quality with a cost reduction.

### Enchanting

Base item cost + enchantment cost = total cost

##### Table: Enchantment Costs
| Modifier | Cost Formula |
|:-|:-|
| Base Cost | Spell Difficulty × Mana Cost |
| Uses per Day | Base Cost × Uses |
| Limited Uses | Base Cost × Uses ÷ 5 |
| Concentration<br/>For Effect | Base Cost × 10 |
| Graze Effect | Base Cost ÷ 2 |
| Critical Effect | Base Cost × 2 |
