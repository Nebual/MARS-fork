## Animism (RES)

Nature is a fundamental force that governs reality, and animism allows you to connect to that force. There are three specializations you can choose from which are the three different ethos of animism: *balance*, *harmony* and *entropy*.

Animists do not require or use scrolls or spell books. Nature itself teaches you how to wield it. You can only have one animism specialization, as they are fundamentally conflicting representations of animism. You acquire a new spell from your specialization when you advance your animism skill.

As you advance in animism you also get bonus spells at specific ranks, regardless of the specialization you choose. These ranks are trained (r4), practiced (r8), exceptional (r12), and accomplished (r16). You get these spells in addition to spells you learn from advancing normally.

##### Table: Animism Bonus Spells
| Roll Value | Step Name | Bonus Spell |
|:-:|:-|:-|
| r4 | Trained | [Speak with Animals](/Fantasy/Spells.md#speak-with-animals) |
| r8 | Practiced | [Animal Form](/Fantasy/Spells.md#animal-form) |
| r12 | Exceptional | Control Plants (?) |
| r16 | Accomplished | Control Weather (?) |

### Balance

Life and death are two sides of the same coin. Those that seek to control one or the other misrepresent the duality of nature. It is only by recognizing this balance that you can see nature as it truly is.

### Entropy

All things must come to an end. This is the mantra of entropy, and you are an agent that represents this notion. Although you do not seek to destroy without cause, you will not hesitate to fulfil the inevitable truth.

### Harmony

Nature is the universal machine to which all existing things are cogs. This machine cannot exist without its pieces holding it together. It is your mission to maintain all things that exist to satisfy the universal machine.

## Arcana (INT)

Arcana is the educated wizard's style of spellcasting, and has five different specializations to choose from which are the five schools of magic: *augury*, *conjuration*, *enchantment*, *evocation*, and *transmutation*.

Since arcana is a book-learned style of spellcasting, it only functions well if you have a book containing scrolls of known spells. Scrolls are essentially a page's worth of spellcasting information on a single spell. As a practicing and inventive wizard, you acquire a new scroll of any spell matching your school when you advance your arcana skill (this represents how you learn spells).

Although you will choose a school to train in, you may cast spells from any school (assuming you have scrolls for those spells). However, if you cast a spell from a school you are not trained in, then you will roll only your intelligence to cast that spell. You can take this skill multiple times to advance in different schools if you want to avoid this limitation and attempt to master all schools.

Wizards are not entirely incapable if they don't have scrolls or their spell books to practice from. If you attempt to cast any spell that you don't have a scroll for, that spell is cast with disadvantage. Spells can only be cast in this way if you are at least trained in that spell's school (you must understand the basics of casting those spells without assistance).

Scrolls can also be acquired by purchasing them from other wizards (including spells that you can't yet learn directly from advancement). These cost an amount of silver equal to that spell's mana cost multiplied by their difficulty.

### Augury

Augurs are the types of wizards who like to know things and solve problems. Augury can be used to learn information that would otherwise be unavailable, or solve simple problems that might require the use of someone with specialized skills.

### Conjuration

Conjurors create illusions or magical tricks; they create effects that aren't real or have limited permanence. These types of effects are usually limited to things you can sense (see, hear, touch, taste, and smell).

### Enchantment

Enchanting is the process of using magic to alter how things function, or improve how they function. This type of magic can be used on both objects and people, and usually results in effects that appear obviously supernatural.

### Evocation

Evokers are normally known for one simple thing: destruction. It is true that evocation is a direct means to accessing destructive forces, but it can also be used to motivate and inspire. Evocation is really about activating deep emotions with the power of magic.

### Transmutation

Transmuters can change one thing into something else, or repair what is broken. Transmutation focuses on the alteration of physical things, and does not necessarily provide results that one would assume are of a magical nature.

## Craft (INT)

Someone must create all the items and artifacts that you use, and that someone could even be you. This skill is used for a wide variety of item crafting. It can be used to create normal everyday items and equipment, including arrows, swords, and armour. It can also be used to create powerful magic items. This skill is considered to be a core advanced skill unique to the fantasy setting.

This skill requires that you have a toolkit dedicated to the type of craft work you want to pursue (or a workshop containing those tools), and most importantly, a background, archetype, or other form of skillset that pertains to the type of items you are crafting. If you do not possess some measure of these things, someone who does can provide you with the means to do so. The specifics of item crafting can be complicated and require the use of a calculator.

## Faith (RES)

Most forms of spellcasting come from an internal source, either force of personality, or years of study. When it comes to faith, however, that power is granted to an individual from a divine entity. Faith represents your devotion to following a code of beliefs that align with that divine entity, and the additional sacrifice of acting on behalf of that entity. Those who follow this lifestyle are often called clerics.

Like most other spellcasting skills, you will pick a specialization. However, unlike other casting skills, that specialization is created from several choices. There are three different choices to make along three different ideological axes: *altruism* or *militarism*, *impulse* or *discipline*, and *liberty* or *authority*. These choices combined result in eight different specializations: *charity*, *family*, *peace*, *service*, *anarchy*, *war*, *justice*, and *order*.

##### Table: Faith Specializations by Ideologies
| Specialization | First Axis | Second Axis | Third Axis |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Charity | Altruism | Impulse | Liberty |
| Family | Altruism | Impulse | Authority |
| Peace | Altruism | Discipline | Liberty |
| Service | Altruism | Discipline | Authority |
| Anarchy | Militarism | Impulse | Liberty |
| War | Militarism | Impulse | Authority |
| Justice | Militarism | Discipline | Liberty |
| Order | Militarism | Discipline | Authority |

Clerics do not require or use scrolls or spell books. You can only have one faith specialization, as it represents the core of your character's philosophical ideologies. You acquire a new spell from your specialization when you advance your faith skill. The spells available for you to choose are determined by each ideology chosen, rather than strictly the specialization itself.

As you advance in faith you also get bonus spells at specific ranks, depending on the specialization you choose. These ranks are adept (r6), proficient (r10), and accomplished (r16). You get these spells in addition to spells you learn from advancing normally.

##### Table: Faith Bonus Spells
| Roll Value | Step Name | Charity | Family | Peace | Service | Anarchy | War | Justice | Order |
|:-:|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| r6 | Adept | Mend | ? | ? | Seek Guidance | ? | ? | ? | ? |
| r10 | Proficient | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? |
| r16 | Accomplished | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? |

### Altruism

When others are in need, it is you who will provide. This ideology spans the providence of both supportive actions and the gifting of material goods. Being altruistic is more than just providing when it is necessary, it is also the search for such opportunities.

### Militarism

While kindness is an option, it is easier to demonstrate the cost of failure with a show of force. Militarism is not solely about violence: it is the drive to demonstrate your ideals even if others do not agree. What people want is not necessarily what people need.

### Impulse

Opportunity is essentially a divine portent. Whenever opportunities arise that align with your goals they must be taken. Any other action is a failure to utilize the divine gift given to you. Searching for opportunities is not necessarily a goal, rather that opportunities are everywhere and just waiting to be seen.

### Discipline

Action itself is less important than recognizing when that action is necessary. Although it may appear as though opportunities are constant, many of which can easily become distractions that prevent you from truly exemplifying your ideals at a better time.

### Liberty

Freedom in all forms matters more to you than any one rule can provide. Although others are free to follow their own paths, if an individual or group's cause stands in the way of the freedom others, then that path is a restriction guised by a mask of freedom.

### Authority

Governance without rule of law can quickly devolve into chaos. Without the guide of authority, actions are easily taken with disregard for consequence. This reckless behaviour can very easily have unintended effects. It is safer to follow law than act without guidance.

## Ki

All things have some form of spirit, and ki is a manifestation of spirit in the form of an aura. Control over ki is control over one's own auras. Typically this form of magic is performed by those who meditate on the deeper parts of themselves. Those who can control their auras are known as sōhei​ or monks. Ki has four different specializations to choose from which are the four auras: *genki*, *kiai*, *shouki*, and *yuuki*.

Monks do not require or use scrolls or spell books. You acquire a new spell from your specialization when you advance your ki skill. You can take this skill multiple times to learn how to control different auras. When you cast a spell using this skill, even if you have multiple specializations, you must cast that spell with the skill you learned it from. Each specialization casts spells using a different primary stat.

Monks of varying specializations can control the energies that govern their bodies. As you advance your ki skill, at specific ranks you gain the ability to convert your resources to another resource as a free action. These ranks are adept (r6), proficient (r10), and accomplished (r16). Each specialization has its own resource conversion ability.

### Genki "Vigour" (STR)

Control of the body, mastery of strength. Genki is the spirit of flesh and might. This aura can be utilized to increase your combat potential and push your strength beyond the natural limits one might think is possible.

##### Table: Genki Resource Conversion
| Roll Value | Step Name | Resource<br/>Conversion |
|:-:|:-|:-|
| r6 | Adept | 4 Endurance into 1 Stamina |
| r10 | Proficient | 3 Endurance into 1 Stamina |
| r16 | Accomplished | 2 Endurance into 1 Stamina |

### Kiai "Projection" (DEX)

Kiai is the spirit of your movement and the air you breathe, the air that feeds your body and mind. With the use of this aura your movements will become fast and effortless, the air around you will become an extension of your body.

##### Table: Kiai Resource Conversion
| Roll Value | Step Name | Resource<br/>Conversion |
|:-:|:-|:-|
| r6 | Adept | 4 Mana into 1 Stamina |
| r10 | Proficient | 3 Mana into 1 Stamina |
| r16 | Accomplished | 2 Mana into 1 Stamina |

### Shouki "Mind" (INT)

Mastery of mind allows you to rely on the power of your thoughts and consciousness rather than the strength of your muscles. Your body will act as a mere vessel holding the extending reach of your mind.

##### Table: Shouki Resource Conversion
| Roll Value | Step Name | Resource<br/>Conversion |
|:-:|:-|:-|
| r6 | Adept | 4 Stamina into 1 Mana |
| r10 | Proficient | 3 Stamina into 1 Mana |
| r16 | Accomplished | 2 Stamina into 1 Mana |

### Yuuki "Courage" (RES)

This is the spirit that holds your body and mind together to act as a single force. With the embodiment of courage you need not body nor mind alone to prove yourself.

##### Table: Yuuki Resource Conversion
| Roll Value | Step Name | Resource<br/>Conversion |
|:-:|:-|:-|
| r6 | Adept | 1 Mana into 2 Endurance |
| r10 | Proficient | 1 Mana into 3 Endurance |
| r16 | Accomplished | 1 Mana into 4 Endurance |

## Power (RES)

Power is the natural wizard's style of spellcasting. Those who wield magic in this way are often referred to as sorcerers rather than wizards. Rather than being described into mechanical categories, the specializations of power are more philosophical. Power has seven different specializations to choose from which are the seven elements: *air*, *earth*, *fire*, *water*, *light*, *darkness*, and *arcane*.

Sorcerers do not require or use scrolls or spell books. The power they wield manifests from force of will rather than education. You acquire a new spell from your specialization when you advance your power skill. You can take this skill multiple times to learn how to cast different elements. When you cast a spell using this skill, even if you have multiple specializations, you must cast that spell with the skill you learned it from.

Sorcerers have it a bit easier than others when it comes to casting spells. As you advance your power skill, at specific ranks you can choose one of your learned spells to become a signature spell. These ranks are practiced (r8), exceptional (r12), accomplished (r16), and master (r20). All signature spells get a reduced difficulty to cast and mana cost based on your advancement. This reduction only applies to signature spells in the same specialization.

##### Table: Power Signature Spell Difficulty Reduction
| Roll Value | Step Name | Difficulty<br/>Reduction | Mana Cost<br/>Reduction |
|:-:|:-|:-:|:-:|
| r8 | Practiced | -1 | -0 |
| r12 | Exceptional | -2 | -1 |
| r16 | Accomplished | -3 | -1 |
| r20 | Master | -4 | -2 |

Whenever you pick a spell that is usable by multiple elements, it may limit your choices in exactly how that spell is cast. For example, if that spell has multiple magic type choices you may only pick the magic type that corresponds to the specialization that spell was learned from. Other restrictions may be listed as a part of the specialization requirement of that spell.

### Air

Power over air allows you to control the wind itself. Lifting and moving objects become as easy to you as the wind can carry a leaf or feather. Sound and electricity are also associated with air.

### Earth

Force and stability are the earth's primary strengths. The element of earth is a true testament to force of will. Additionally, this covers the domain of plants.

### Fire

If you try hard enough just about anything can be burned. Strong emotions like anger and love are also aspects of fire. Fire is about passion and intensity.

### Water

Water is about more than just getting things wet; water also represents flow and calming energy. Although sound is generally associated with air, you could say that music is also like water. Cold temperatures and cold elemental damage is also associated with water.

### Light

While illumination is quite literal, and truth is quite philosophical, they are very similar in nature. Light is about revealing what is hidden.

### Darkness

As a counter to light, darkness is about concealment. Darkness is not simply evil. Some truths are painful to bear, and darkness would rather hide those truths.

### Arcane

The power of arcane represents the space between space. Many things that one might describe as blatantly magical are more accurately arcane. Arcane is a powerful force that seems to defy the normal rules that might apply to the other elements.
