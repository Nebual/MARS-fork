## Animism (INT)

Nature is a fundamental force that governs reality, and animism allows you to connect to that force. There are three specializations you can choose from which are the three different ethos of animism: *balance*, *harmony* and *entropy*.

Animists do not require or use scrolls or spell books. Nature itself teaches you how to wield it. You acquire a new spell from your specialization when you advance your animism skill. You can only have one animism specialization, as they are fundamentally conflicting representations of animism.

As you advance in animism you also get bonus spells at specific ranks, regardless of the specialization you choose. You get these spells in addition to spells you learn from advancing normally.

##### Table: Animism Bonus Spells
| Roll Value | Step Name | Bonus Spell |
|:-:|:-|:-|
| r4 | Trained | Speak to Animals (?) |
| r8 | Practiced | Animal Form (?) |
| r12 | Exceptional | Control Plants (?) |
| r16 | Accomplished | Alter Weather (?) |

### Balance

Life and death are two sides of the same coin. Those that seek to control one or the other misrepresent the duality of nature. It is only by recognizing this balance that you can see nature as it truly is.

### Harmony

Nature is the universal machine to which all existing things are cogs. This machine cannot exist without its pieces holding it together. It is your mission to maintain all things that exist to satisfy the universal machine.

### Entropy

All things must come to an end. This is the mantra of entropy, and you are an agent that represents this notion. Although you do not seek to destroy without cause, you will not hesitate to fulfil the inevitable truth.

## Arcana (INT)

Arcana is the educated wizard's style of spellcasting, and has five different specializations to choose from which are the five schools of magic: *augury*, *conjuration*, *enchantment*, *evocation*, and *transmutation*.

Since arcana is a book-learned style of spellcasting, it only functions well if you have a book containing scrolls of known spells. Scrolls are essentially a page's worth of spellcasting information on a single spell. As a practicing and inventive wizard, you acquire a new scroll of any spell matching your school when you advance your arcana skill (this represents how you learn spells). Scrolls can also be acquired by purchasing them from other wizards (including spells that you can't yet learn directly from advancement).

Although you will choose a school to train in, you may cast spells from any school (assuming you have scrolls for those spells). However, if you cast a spell from a school you are not trained in, then you will roll only your intelligence to cast that spell. You can take this skill multiple times to advance in different schools if you want to avoid this limitation and attempt to master all schools.

Wizards are not entirely incapable if they don't have scrolls or their spell books to practice from. If you attempt to cast any spell that you don't have a scroll for, that spell is cast with disadvantage. Spells can only be cast in this way if you are at least trained in that spell's school (you must understand the basics of casting those spells without assistance).

### Augury

Augurs are the types of wizards who like to know things and solve problems. Augury can be used to learn information that would otherwise be unavailable, or solve simple problems that might require the use of someone with specialized skills.

### Conjuration

Conjurors create illusions or magical tricks; they create effects that aren't real or have limited permanence. These types of effects are usually limited to things you can sense (see, hear, touch, taste, and smell).

### Enchantment

Enchanting is the process of using magic to alter how things function, or improve how they function. This type of magic can be used on both objects and people, and usually results in effects that appear obviously supernatural.

### Evocation

Evokers are normally known for one simple thing: destruction. It is true that evocation is a direct means to accessing destructive forces, but it can also be used to motivate and inspire. Evocation is really about activating deep emotions with the power of magic.

### Transmutation

Transmuters can change one thing into something else, or repair what is broken. Transmutation focuses on the alteration of physical things, and does not necessarily provide results that one would assume are of a magical nature.

## Craft (INT)

Someone must create all the items and artifacts that you use, and that someone could even be you.

The first step to crafting an item is just a matter of roleplaying: is a workshop or marketplace available, or do you carry the tools necessary to build this item? Afterwards, there are three basic steps:

* Determine the total cost and craft difficulty
* Roll a craft check
* Determine craft progress and pay the immediate cost

The difficulty value to craft an item is based on its cost. This can be determined manually by finding the square root of the cost in silver pieces, then adding 4 to the result. The following table can be used as a quick reference.

##### Table: Item Cost vs Craft Difficulty
| Item Cost | Difficulty | Item Cost | Difficulty |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 1sp+ | 5 | 225sp+ | 19 |
| 4sp+ | 6 | 256sp+ | 20 |
| 9sp+ | 7 | 289sp+ | 21 |
| 16sp+ | 8 | 324sp+ | 22 |
| 25sp+ | 9 | 361sp+ | 23 |
| 36sp+ | 10 | 400sp+ | 24 |
| 49sp+ | 11 | 441sp+ | 25 |
| 64sp+ | 12 | 484sp+ | 26 |
| 81sp+ | 13 | 529sp+ | 27 |
| 100sp+ | 14 | 576sp+ | 28 |
| 121sp+ | 15 | 625sp+ | 29 |
| 144sp+ | 16 | 676sp+ | 30 |
| 169sp+ | 17 | 729sp+ | 31 |
| 196sp+ | 18 | 784sp+ | 32 |

After you have determined the item's cost and difficulty, make a craft check. Your roll determines the percentage of your crafting progress and how much you will pay immediately, representing the raw ingredients that are used up to create the item. Multiply the item's cost by the progress percentage and then adjust accordingly if you rolled a success or critical, rounding up:

***Critical:*** Gain 50% progress and pay half price.  
***Success:*** Gain 20% progress and pay three quarters price.  
***Graze:*** Gain 10% progress and pay full price.  
***Fail:*** Gain 2% progress and pay full price.  
***Fumble:*** Lose 5% progress.

If you roll three times the difficulty or higher, then you craft the whole item immediately, paying half price.

Make sure to prepare enough money to pay for the item. If you can't pay for your progress, then no progress is made.

Each craft check made represents a single day's worth of crafting time spent on that item.

> ##### Crafting Example
> ___
> **Craft:** r12
>
> **Intelligence:** r12+1
>
> **Craft Check Roll:** r24+1
> ___
> **Item:** Brigandine
>
> **Cost:** 40sp
>
> **Difficulty:** 10
>
> | Roll | Progress | Cost |
> |:-:|:-:|:-:|
> | 12 (Success) | +20% = 20% | 6sp |
> | 16 (Success) | +20% = 40% | 6sp |
> | 10 (Graze) | +10% = 50% | 4sp |
> | 6 (Fail) | +2% = 52% | 8cp |
> | 13 (Success) | +20% = 72% | 6sp |
> | 21 (Critical) | +28% (50%) = 100% | 5sp 6cp |
> ___
> **Time Spent:** 6 Days
>
> **Total Cost:** 28sp 4cp (71% of cost)

### Upgrading Items

Crafting can also be used to improve items from one quality to the next by treating the difference in item value as the cost of the item. You cannot upgrade into a quality with a cost reduction.

> ##### Upgrade Example
> ___
> **Craft:** r12
>
> **Intelligence:** r12+1
>
> **Craft Check Roll:** r24+1
> ___
> **Item:** Longsword to Fine Longsword
>
> **Cost:** 10sp (10sp to 20sp)
>
> **Difficulty:** 8
>
> | Roll | Progress | Cost |
> |:-:|:-:|:-:|
> | 8 (Graze) | +10% = 10% | 1sp |
> | 17 (Critical) | +50% = 60% | 2sp 3cp |
> | 11 (Success) | +20% = 80% | 2sp |
> | 19 (Critical) | +20% (50%) = 100% | 1sp |
> ___
> **Time Spent:** 4 Days
>
> **Total Cost:** 6sp 3cp (63% of cost)

Items in progress cannot be used until they are completed.

### Crafting Magical Items

Work in progress.

Base item cost + magic cost = total cost

##### Table: Magical Item Costs
| Modifier | Cost Formula |
|:-|:-|
| Magic Cost | Mana Cost × Spell Difficulty |
| Uses per Day | Magic Cost × Uses |
| Limited Uses | Magic Cost × Uses ÷ 5 |
| Concentration<br/>For Effect<br/>(Unlimited Uses) | Magic Cost × 5 |
| Concentration<br/>For Effect<br/>(Limited Uses) | Magic Cost × Uses ÷ 2 |
| Graze Effect | Magic Cost ÷ 2 |
| Critical Effect | Magic Cost × 2 |

## Ki

All things have some form of spirit, and ki is a manifestation of spirit in the form of an aura. Control over ki is control over one's own auras. Typically this form of magic is performed by those who meditate on the deeper parts of themselves. Those who can control their auras are known as sōhei​ or monks.

Monks do not require or use scrolls or spell books. You acquire a new spell from your specialization when you advance your ki skill. You can take this skill multiple times to learn how to control different auras. When you cast a spell using this skill, even if you have multiple specializations, you must cast that spell with the skill you learned it from. Each specialization cast spells using a different primary stat.

Monks of varying specializations can control the energies that govern their bodies. As you advance your ki skill, at specific ranks you gain the ability to convert your resources to another resource as a free action. These ranks are trained (r4), practiced (r8), and exceptional (r12). Each specialization has its own resource conversion ability.

### Genki "Vigour" (STR)

Control of the body, mastery of strength. Genki is the spirit of flesh and might. This aura can be utilized to increase your combat potential and push your strength beyond the natural limits one might think is possible.

##### Table: Genki Resource Conversion
| Roll Value | Step Name | Resource<br/>Conversion |
|:-:|:-|:-|
| r4 | Trained | 4 Endurance into 1 Stamina |
| r8 | Practiced | 3 Endurance into 1 Stamina |
| r12 | Exceptional | 2 Endurance into 1 Stamina |

### Kiai "Projection" (DEX)

Kiai the spirit of your movement and the air you breathe, the air that feeds your body and mind. With the use of this aura your movements will become fast and effortless, the air around you will become an extension of your body.

##### Table: Kiai Resource Conversion
| Roll Value | Step Name | Resource<br/>Conversion |
|:-:|:-|:-|
| r4 | Trained | 4 Mana into 1 Stamina |
| r8 | Practiced | 3 Mana into 1 Stamina |
| r12 | Exceptional | 2 Mana into 1 Stamina |

### Shouki "Mind" (INT)

Mastery of mind allows you to rely on the power of your thoughts and consciousness rather than the strength of your muscles. Your body will act as a mere vessel holding the extending reach of your mind.

##### Table: Shouki Resource Conversion
| Roll Value | Step Name | Resource<br/>Conversion |
|:-:|:-|:-|
| r4 | Trained | 4 Stamina into 1 Mana |
| r8 | Practiced | 3 Stamina into 1 Mana |
| r12 | Exceptional | 2 Stamina into 1 Mana |

### Yuuki "Courage" (RES)

This is the spirit that holds your body and mind together to act as a single force. With the embodiment of courage you need not body nor mind alone to prove yourself.

##### Table: Yuuki Resource Conversion
| Roll Value | Step Name | Resource<br/>Conversion |
|:-:|:-|:-|
| r4 | Trained | 1 Mana into 2 Endurance |
| r8 | Practiced | 1 Mana into 3 Endurance |
| r12 | Exceptional | 1 Mana into 4 Endurance |

## Power (RES)

Power is the natural wizard's style of spellcasting. Those who wield magic in this way are often referred to as sorcerers rather than wizards. Rather than being described into mechanical categories, the specializations of power are more philosophical. Power has seven different specializations to choose from which are the seven classical elements: *air*, *earth*, *fire*, *water*, *light*, *dark*, and *arcane*.

Sorcerers do not require or use scrolls or spell books. The power they wield manifests from force of will rather than education. You acquire a new spell from your specialization when you advance your power skill. You can take this skill multiple times to learn how to cast different elements. When you cast a spell using this skill, even if you have multiple specializations, you must cast that spell with the skill you learned it from.

Sorcerers have it a bit easier than others when it comes to casting spells. As you advance your power skill, at specific ranks you can choose one of your learned spells to become a signature spell. These ranks are practiced (r8), exceptional (r12), accomplished (r16), and master (r20). All signature spells get a reduced difficulty to cast based on your advancement. This reduction only applies to signature spells in the same specialization.

##### Table: Power Signature Spell Difficulty Reduction
| Roll Value | Step Name | Difficulty<br/>Reduction |
|:-:|:-|:-:|
| r8 | Practiced | –1 |
| r12 | Exceptional | –2 |
| r16 | Accomplished | –3 |
| r20 | Master | –4 |

Whenever you pick a spell that is usable by multiple elements, it may limit your choices in exactly how that spell is cast. For example, if that spell has multiple magic type choices you may only pick the magic type that corresponds to the specialization that spell was learned from. Other restrictions may be listed as a part of the specialization requirement of that spell.

### Air

Power over air allows you to control the wind itself. Lifting and moving objects become as easy to you as the wind can carry a leaf or feather. Sound and eletricity are also associated with air.

### Earth

Force and stability are the earth's primary strengths. The element of earth is a true testament to force of will. Additionally, this covers the domain of plants.

### Fire

If you try hard enough just about anything can be burned. Strong emotions like anger and love are also aspects of fire.

### Water

Water is about more than just getting things wet; water also represents flow and calming energy. Although sound is generally associated with air, you could say that music is also like water.

### Light

While illumination is quite literal, and truth is quite philosophical, they are very similar in nature. Light is about revealing what is hidden.

### Dark

As a counter to light, darkness is about concealment. Darkness is not simply evil. Some truths are painful to bear, and darkness would rather hide those truths.

### Arcane

The power of arcane represents the space between space. Many things that one might describe as blatantly magical are more accurately arcane. Arcane is a powerful force that seems to defy the normal rules that might apply to the other elements.
