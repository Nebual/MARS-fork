## Artificer

Artificers are gifted craftspersons that are capable of inventing all kinds of devices with the assistance of magic. Some of these devices they use themselves, but some artificers prefer to craft solely to witness others benefit from their inventions.

**Skills** [Arcana (Any)](/Fantasy/Skills.md#arcana-int) (r6), [Charisma](/Basic/PHB.md#charisma-res) or [Knowledge](/Basic/PHB.md#knowledge-int) (r6), [Craft](/Basic/PHB.md#craft-int) (r6), [Perception](/Basic/PHB.md#perception-dex) (r6), [Sleight](/Basic/PHB.md#sleight-dex) (r6)  
**Spells** Artificers start with two spells.  
**Talent** [Arcane Synthesis (Rank 1)](/Fantasy/Talents.md#arcane-synthesis)  
**Primary Stat** Artificer must start with a maximum intelligence of 11 or greater.

## Bard

Bards, much like wizards, are educated and personable. Bards use cleverness and a sharp tongue to overcome challenges. Given the more well-rounded education and breadth of skill that a bard possesses, they might be considered a jack-of-all-trades. They are often a reasonable substitute when a specialist is unavailable.

**Skills** [Arcana (Any)](/Fantasy/Skills.md#arcana-int) (r4), [Charisma](/Basic/PHB.md#charisma-res) (r8), [Finesse](/Basic/PHB.md#finesse-dex) or [Ranged](/Basic/PHB.md#ranged-dex) (r6), [Knowledge](/Basic/PHB.md#knowledge-int) (r6), [Perception](/Basic/PHB.md#perception-dex) (r4)

**Spells** Bards start with one spell.  
**Talent** [Inspirational Charisma (+1)](/Basic/Talents.md#inspirational-charisma)  
**Primary Stat** Bards must start with a maximum resolve of 11 or greater.

## Champion

While clerics can represent the full spectrum of the devoted, champions represent the militaristic strong arm of these ideologies. They are there to protect those they declare in need, primarly those who follow tenets resembling their own. They are often drafted as mercenaries to empires who show loyalty to their cause.

**Skills** [Athletics](/Basic/PHB.md#athletics-str) (r6), [Faith (Any Militarist)](/Fantasy/Skills.md#faith-res) (r6), [Finesse](/Basic/PHB.md#finesse-dex), [Martial](/Basic/PHB.md#martial-dex), or [Ranged](/Basic/PHB.md#ranged-dex) (r6), [Medicine](/Basic/PHB.md#medicine-int) (r6), [Perception](/Basic/PHB.md#perception-dex) (r6)

**Spells** Champions start with two spells.  
**Talent** [Divine Axiom (Any)](/Fantasy/Talents.md#divine-axiom)  
**Primary Stat** Champions must start with a maximum resolve of 11 or greater.

## Cleric

Many people have a code they follow that defines who they are, but clerics make it a part of their life's work. Clerics are often guides and teachers. Despite the work put into their faith and those involved, they typically do not create their own following. They are more likely to gather a following in the name of whatever divine entity they believe in, rather than for themselves.

**Skills** [Charisma](/Basic/PHB.md#charisma-res) (r4), [Faith (Any)](/Fantasy/Skills.md#faith-res) (r8), [Knowledge](/Basic/PHB.md#knowledge-int) (r6), [Medicine](/Basic/PHB.md#medicine-int) (r6), [Perception](/Basic/PHB.md#perception-dex) (r4)  
**Spells** Clerics start with three spells, and one bonus spell (depending on their specialization).  
**Talent** [Divine Devotion (1/rest)](/Fantasy/Talents.md#divine-devotion)  
**Primary Stat** Clerics must start with a maximum resolve of 11 or greater.

## Druid

Druids are magic users that are in tune with the forces of nature. Druids are rare to meet as they are typically ascetics who abstain from civilization. While many of them do live in the wild, often disguised as animals, some of them do occasionally interact with other people. Sometimes this is just to maintain some form of diplomatic position, or to dissuade others from encroaching on nature.

**Skills** [Agility](/Basic/PHB.md#agility-dex) or [Athletics](/Basic/PHB.md#athletics-str) (r4), [Animism (Any)](/Fantasy/Skills.md#animism-res) (r8), [Medicine](/Basic/PHB.md#medicine-int) (r4), [Perception](/Basic/PHB.md#perception-dex) (r6), [Wild Empathy](/Basic/PHB.md#wild-empathy-res) (r6)  
**Spells** Druids start with three spells, and two bonus spells: [Speak with Animals](/Fantasy/Spells.md#speak-with-animals) and [Animal Form](/Fantasy/Spells.md#animal-form).  
**Talent** [Wild Magic](/Fantasy/Talents.md#wild-magic)  
**Primary Stat** Druids must start with a maximum resolve of 11 or greater.

## Monk

Body, mind, and spirit are the domains of monks. Through meditation and constant martial discipline, monks are capable of asserting forces beyond what one might believe possible. Typically monks do not seek confrontation despite their ability to handle themselves in combat. The way of the monk is more about mastery of one's-self rather than mastery over others. This does not mean that monks are pacifists, however, as they will often defend themselves if given good reason.

**Skills** [Agility](/Basic/PHB.md#agility-dex) or [Athletics](/Basic/PHB.md#athletics-str) (r6), [Finesse](/Basic/PHB.md#finesse-dex), [Martial](/Basic/PHB.md#martial-dex), or [Unarmed](/Basic/PHB.md#unarmed-dex) (r6), [Ki (Any)](/Fantasy/Skills.md#ki) (r8), [Medicine](/Basic/PHB.md#medicine-int) (r4), [Perception](/Basic/PHB.md#perception-dex) (r4)  
**Maneuvers** Monks start with one maneuver.  
**Spells** Monks start with three spells.  
**Talent** [Meditative Rest (+2/+1)](/Basic/Talents.md#meditative-rest)  
**Primary Stat** Monks must start with a maximum resolve of 11 or greater.

## Sorcerer

Sorcerers are like wizards in that they are known for their magic, but it is not a power they have learned from study. This ability to cast spells is innate and a major part of their personality. As a result, sorcerers are often outgoing and are highly sociable, even with animals.

**Skills** [Agility](/Basic/PHB.md#agility-dex) or [Athletics](/Basic/PHB.md#athletics-str) (r4), [Charisma](/Basic/PHB.md#charisma-res) (r6), [Contacts](/Basic/PHB.md#contacts-res) (r4), [Sorcery (Any)](/Fantasy/Skills.md#sorcery-res) (r8), [Wild Empathy](/Basic/PHB.md#wild-empathy-res) (r6)  
**Spells** Sorcerers start with three spells, and one of those spells is designated as a signature spell.  
**Talent** [Esoteric Will](/Fantasy/Talents.md#esoteric-will)  
**Primary Stat** Sorcerers must start with a maximum resolve of 11 or greater.

## Theurge

Theurges are powerful spellcasters dedicated to the pursuit of occult mastery. In addition to educating themselves on how to cast spells, they will also devote themselves to a higher power to acquire more spellcasting ability. Theurges believe they are more powerful than other spellcasters, but due to their higher rate of seclusion in the pursuit of eldritch knowledge, they are also typically lesser known.

**Skills** [Arcana (Any)](/Fantasy/Skills.md#arcana-int) (r8), [Faith (Any)](/Fantasy/Skills.md#faith-res) (r6), [Knowledge](/Basic/PHB.md#knowledge-int) (r6), [Medicine](/Basic/PHB.md#medicine-int) (r4), [Perception](/Basic/PHB.md#perception-dex) (r4)  
**Spells** Theurges start with three spells in arcana, two spells in faith, and one bonus spell in faith (depending on their specialization).  
**Talent** [Metamagic (Any)](/Fantasy/Talents.md#metamagic)  
**Primary Stat** Theurges must start with a maximum intelligence or maximum resolve of 13 or greater.

## Warmage

Where fighters might represent more varied martial roles, warmages are trained specifically for war. Empires prefer to employ warmages due to their affiliation with the military, rather than wizards who are more likely to seek their own interests.

**Skills** [Athletics](/Basic/PHB.md#athletics-str) (r6), [Arcana (Enchantment or Transmutation)](/Fantasy/Skills.md#arcana-int) (r6), [Finesse](/Basic/PHB.md#finesse-dex), [Martial](/Basic/PHB.md#martial-dex), or [Ranged](/Basic/PHB.md#ranged-dex) (r6), [Medicine](/Basic/PHB.md#medicine-int) (r6), [Perception](/Basic/PHB.md#perception-dex) (r6)  
**Maneuvers** Warmages start with one maneuver.  
**Spells** Warmages start with two spells.  
**Talent** [Eldritch Infusion](/Fantasy/Talents.md#eldritch-infusion), [Toughness (+4)](/Basic/Talents.md#toughness)  
**Primary Stat** Warmages must start with a maximum intelligence of 11 or greater.

## Wizard

Although wizards are known for feats of magical performance and knowledge of ancient secrets, it is more than that. Wizards like clerics, are often guides and teachers; they are known because of their relationships with others. Wizards are often sought out by adventurers and normal folk alike to help them find a solution to their problems, even if magic isn't the required answer.

**Skills** [Arcana (Any)](/Fantasy/Skills.md#arcana-int) (r8), [Charisma](/Basic/PHB.md#charisma-res) (r4), [Knowledge](/Basic/PHB.md#knowledge-int) (r6), [Medicine](/Basic/PHB.md#medicine-int) (r6), [Perception](/Basic/PHB.md#perception-dex) (r4)  
**Spells** Wizards start with three spells.  
**Talent** [Arcane Precision (1/spell)](/Fantasy/Talents.md#arcane-precision)  
**Primary Stat** Wizards must start with a maximum intelligence of 11 or greater.
