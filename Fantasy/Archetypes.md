## Bard

Bards, much like wizards, are educated and personable. Bards use cleverness, skill, and a sharp tongue to overcome challenges. Given the more well-rounded education and breadth of skill that a bard possesses they might be considered a jack-of-all-trades and are often a reasonable substitute where a specialist is unavailable. At the very least, the bard may know someone who can help, and how to convince them.

**Skills** Acrobatics (1d4), Charisma (1d8), Finesse or Ranged (1d6), Contacts, Knowledge, or Lore (1d6), Perception (1d4)  
**Talent** Inspirational Charisma (+0), Toughness (+4)  
**Primary Stat** Bards must start with a maximum resolve of 11 or greater.

## Fighter

No matter the reason, either to defend the weak, for honor, for glory, or for revenge, fighters are skilled in the arts of combat and warfare. Through the use of various combat maneuvers, fighters are vital to winning various conflicts of physical prowess.

**Skills** Athletics (1d6), Charisma (1d4), Medicine (1d6), Finesse, Martial, or Ranged (1d8), Stealth or Perception (1d4)  
**Talent** Toughness (+8)  
**Primary Stat** Fighters must start with either a maximum strength or maximum dexterity of 11 or greater.

## Ranger

Some people prefer to live among nature, where insight is a key component to survival and understanding. Survival in nature requires a keen eye and a sharp mind; those who call themselves rangers have a strong ability to solve puzzles or understand complicated mysteries.

**Skills** Athletics or Stealth (1d6), Medicine (1d6), Perception (1d6), Finesse, Martial, or Ranged (1d6), Wild Empathy (1d6)  
**Talent** Deduction, Toughness (+4)  
**Primary Stat** Rangers must start with a maximum intelligence of 11 or greater.

## Rogue

The world is full of dangers and unknowns. Rogues live and breathe in the world of peril, prepared to fight back with sharp wits or sharp blades. They are particularly known for their ability to tamper with various devices, such as traps and locks. It is likely that they are great thieves and smugglers, but it wouldn't be safe to say it to their faces.

**Skills** Acrobatics or Charisma (1d4), Finesse or Ranged (1d6), Perception (1d6), Sleight (1d8), Stealth (1d4)  
**Talent** Danger Sense  
**Primary Stat** Rogues must start with a maximum dexterity of 11 or greater.

## Wizard

Although wizards are known for feats of magical performance and knowledge of ancient secrets, it is more than that. Wizards are guides and teachers; they are known because of their relationships with others. Wizards often are sought out by adventurers and normal folk alike to help them find a solution to their problems, even if magic isn't the answer.

**Skills** Arcana (Any) (1d8), Charisma (1d4), Knowledge or Lore (1d6), Medicine (1d6), Perception (1d4)  
**Talent** Arcane Precision  
**Primary Stat** Wizards must start with a maximum intelligence of 11 or greater.
