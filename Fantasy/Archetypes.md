## Artificer

Artificers are gifted craftspersons, that are capable of inventing all kinds of devices with the assistance of magic. Some of these devices they use themselves, but some artificers prefer craft solely to witness others benefit from their inventions.

**Skills** Arcana (Any) (r6), Charisma (r6), Craft (r6), Perception (r6), Sleight (r6)  
**Spells** Artificer starts with two spells.  
**Talent** [Arcane Synthesis (1/rest)](/Fantasy/Talents.md#arcane-synthesis)  
**Primary Stat** Artificer must start with a maximum intelligence of 11 or greater.

## Assassin

Rogues may have a bad reputation in some circles, but that's mostly the fault of assassins. It's not entirely without reason, however, as both assassins and rogues prefer to slink in the shadows. Assassins excel primarily at inflicting death. While this is true, they owe it to their medicinal knowledge. This type of knowledge allows them to prepare both poisons and antidotes.

**Skills** Acrobatics (r4), Finesse or Ranged (r6), Perception (r4), Medicine (r6), Stealth (r8)  
**Maneuvers** Assassins start with one maneuver.  
**Talent** [Ambidexterity (-3)](/Basic/Talents.md#ambidexterity)  
**Primary Stat** Assassins must start with a maximum dexterity of 11 or greater.

## Bard

Bards, much like wizards, are educated and personable. Bards use cleverness, skill, and a sharp tongue to overcome challenges. Given the more well-rounded education and breadth of skill that a bard possesses they might be considered a jack-of-all-trades and are often a reasonable substitute where a specialist is unavailable. At the very least, the bard may know someone who can help, and how to convince them.

**Skills** Arcana (Any) (r4), Charisma (r8), Finesse or Ranged (r6), Contacts, Knowledge, or Lore (r6), Perception (r4)  
**Maneuvers** Bards start with one maneuver.  
**Spells** Bards start with one spell.  
**Talent** [Inspirational Charisma (+0)](/Basic/Talents.md#inspirational-charisma), [Toughness (+4)](/Basic/Talents.md#toughness)  
**Primary Stat** Bards must start with a maximum resolve of 11 or greater.

## Berserker

While fighters might choose diplomacy, or paladins might seek to protect their allies, berserkers live for combat above all else. Berserkers can harness the power of pure rage in combat to deliver powerful blows and shrug off pain. Typically, those who might call themselves berserkers are those from more tribal militaristic societies, or those who engage in the sport of fighting others like gladiators.

**Skills** Athletics (r6), Charimsa (r6), Martial (r8), Unarmed (r4), Wild Empathy (r4)  
**Maneuvers** Berserkers start with two maneuvers for martial, and one maneuver for unarmed.  
**Talent** [Rage (+1)](/Basic/Talents.md#rage), [Toughness (+4)](/Basic/Talents.md#toughness)  
**Primary Stat** Berserkers must start with a maximum strength and a maximum resolve of 11 or greater.

## Cleric

Many people have a code they follow that defines who they are, but clerics make it a part of their life's work. Clerics are often guides and teachers. Despite the work put into their faith and those involved, they typically do not create their own following. They are more likely to gather a following in the name of whatever divine entity they believe in, than for themselves.

**Skills** Charisma (r4), Faith (Any) (r8), Knowledge or Lore (r6), Medicine (r6), Perception (r4)  
**Spells** Clerics start with three spells, and one bonus spell (depending on their specialization).  
**Talent** [Divine Devotion (1/rest)](/Fantasy/Talents.md#divine-devotion)  
**Primary Stat** Clerics must start with a maximum resolve of 11 or greater.

## Druid

Druids are magic users that are in tune with the forces of nature. Druids are rare to meet as they are typically ascetics who abstain from civilization. While many of them do live in the wild, often disguised as animals, some of them do occasionally interact with other people. Sometimes this is just to maintain some form of diplomatic position, or to dissuade others from encroaching on nature.

**Skills** Acrobatics, Athletics, or Stealth (r4), Animism (Any) (r8), Medicine (r4), Perception (r6), Wild Empathy (r6)  
**Spells** Druids start with three spells, and two bonus spells: Speak with Animals and Animal Form.  
**Talent** [Wild Magic](/Fantasy/Talents.md#wild-magic)  
**Primary Stat** Druids must start with a maximum resolve of 11 or greater.

## Fighter

No matter the reason, either to defend the weak, for honor, for glory, or for revenge, fighters are skilled in the arts of combat and warfare. Through the use of various combat maneuvers, fighters are vital to winning various conflicts of physical prowess. Although fighters are primarily combatants, they are also often skilled in the application of medicine, and voices of diplomacy.

**Skills** Athletics (r6), Charisma (r4), Medicine (r6), Finesse, Martial, or Ranged (r8), Stealth or Perception (r4)  
**Maneuvers** Fighters start with two maneuvers.  
**Talent** [Toughness (+8)](/Basic/Talents.md#toughness)  
**Primary Stat** Fighters must start with either a maximum strength or maximum dexterity of 11 or greater.

## Monk

Body, mind, and spirit are the domains of monks. Through meditation and constant martial discipline, monks are capable of asserting forces beyond what one might believe possible. Typically monks do not seek confrontation despite their ability to handle themselves in combat. The way of the monk is more about mastery of one's-self rather than mastery over others. This does not mean that monks are pacifists, however, as they will often defend themselves if given good reason.

**Skills** Acrobatics or Athletics (r6), Finesse, Martial, or Unarmed (r6), Ki (Any) (r8), Medicine (r4), Perception (r4)  
**Maneuvers** Monks start with one maneuver.  
**Spells** Monks start with three spells.  
**Talent** [Meditative Rest (+2)](/Basic/Talents.md#meditative-rest)  
**Primary Stat** Monks must start with a maximum resolve of 11 or greater.

## Paladin

While clerics can represent the full spectrum of the devoted, paladins represent the militaristic strong arm of these ideologies. They are there to protect those they declare in need, primarly those who follow tenets resembling their own. They are often drafted as mercenaries to empires who show loyalty to their cause.

**Skills** Athletics (r6), Faith (Militarist) (r6), Finesse, Martial, or Ranged (r6), Lore or Medicine (r6), Stealth or Perception (r6)  
**Maneuvers** Paladins start with one maneuver.  
**Spells** Paladins start with two spells.  
**Talent** [Divine Axiom (Any)](/Fantasy/Talents.md#divine-axiom), [Toughness (+4)](/Basic/Talents.md#toughness)  
**Primary Stat** Paladins must start with a maximum resolve of 11 or greater.

## Ranger

Some people prefer to live among nature, where insight is a key component to survival and understanding. Survival in nature requires a keen eye and a sharp mind; those who call themselves rangers have a strong ability to solve puzzles or understand complicated mysteries.

**Skills** Athletics or Stealth (r6), Medicine (r6), Perception (r6), Finesse, Martial, or Ranged (r6), Wild Empathy (r6)  
**Maneuvers** Rangers start with one maneuver.  
**Talent** [Deduction](/Basic/Talents.md#deduction), [Toughness (+4)](/Basic/Talents.md#toughness)  
**Primary Stat** Rangers must start with a maximum intelligence of 11 or greater.

## Rogue

The world is full of dangers and unknowns. Rogues live and breathe in the world of peril, prepared to fight back with sharp wits or sharp blades. They are particularly known for their ability to tamper with various devices, such as traps and locks. It is likely that they are great thieves and smugglers, but it wouldn't be safe to say it to their faces.

**Skills** Acrobatics or Charisma (r4), Finesse or Ranged (r6), Perception (r6), Sleight (r8), Stealth (r4)  
**Maneuvers** Rogues start with one maneuver.  
**Talent** [Danger Sense](/Basic/Talents.md#danger-sense)  
**Primary Stat** Rogues must start with a maximum dexterity of 11 or greater.

## Sorcerer

Sorcerers are like wizards in that they are known for their magic, but it is not a power they have learned from study. This ability to cast spells is innate and a major part of their personality. As a result, sorcerers are often outgoing and are highly sociable, even with animals.

**Skills** Acrobatics or Athletics (r4), Charisma (r6), Contacts (r4), Power (Any) (r8), Wild Empathy (r6)  
**Spells** Sorcerers start with three spells, and one of those spells is designated as a signature spell.  
**Talent** [Esoteric Will](/Fantasy/Talents.md#esoteric-will)  
**Primary Stat** Sorcerers must start with a maximum resolve of 11 or greater.

## Theurge

Theurges are powerful spellcasters dedicated to the pursuit of occult mastery. In addition to educating themselves on how to cast spells, they will also devote themselves to a higher power to acquire more spellcasting ability. Theurges believe they are more powerful than other spellcasters, but due to their higher rate of seclusion in the pursuit of eldritch knowledge, they are also typically lesser known.

**Skills** Arcana (Any) (r8), Charisma (r4), Faith (Any) (r6), Knowledge, Lore, or Medicine (r6), Perception (r4)  
**Spells** Theurges start with three spells in arcana, two spells in faith, and one bonus spell in faith (depending on their specialization).  
**Talent** [Metamagic (Any)](/Fantasy/Talents.md#metamagic)  
**Primary Stat** Theurges must start with a maximum intelligence or maximum resolve of 13 or greater.

## Warmage

Where fighters might represent more varied martial roles, warmages are trained specifically for war. Empires prefer to employ warmages due to their affiliation with the military, rather than wizards who are more likely to seek their own interests.

**Skills** Athletics (r6), Arcana (Enchantment or Transmutation) (r6), Finesse, Martial, or Ranged (r6), Lore or Medicine (r6), Stealth or Perception (r6)  
**Maneuvers** Warmages start with one maneuver.  
**Spells** Warmages start with two spells.  
**Talent** [Eldritch Infusion](/Fantasy/Talents.md#eldritch-infusion), [Toughness (+4)](/Basic/Talents.md#toughness)  
**Primary Stat** Warmages must start with a maximum intelligence of 11 or greater.

## Wizard

Although wizards are known for feats of magical performance and knowledge of ancient secrets, it is more than that. Wizards like clerics, are often guides and teachers; they are known because of their relationships with others. Wizards are often sought out by adventurers and normal folk alike to help them find a solution to their problems, even if magic isn't the required answer.

**Skills** Arcana (Any) (r8), Charisma (r4), Knowledge or Lore (r6), Medicine (r6), Perception (r4)  
**Spells** Wizards start with three spells.  
**Talent** [Arcane Precision](/Fantasy/Talents.md#arcane-precision)  
**Primary Stat** Wizards must start with a maximum intelligence of 11 or greater.
