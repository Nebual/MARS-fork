## Distracting Strike

**Specializations:** Finesse, Martial, Unarmed

**Stamina Cost:** 2  
**Action Speed:** Standard

**Resist:** Willpower

Make a melee attack with +1 to hit. If successful, the target must lose concentration on a spell. If they do, they cannot cast that spell on their next turn.

## Spell Deflection

**Specializations:** Finesse, Martial, Ranged, Unarmed

**Stamina Cost:** 1  
**Action Speed:** Reaction

Get a +1 bonus to resist an incoming spell that targets only you. If you also have the Intercept maneuver, you may use this maneuver like the Intercept maneuver on an adjacent ally who is targeted by a spell. If you do, you get +2 to resist the incoming spell instead of +1. You may also block that spell for free as a part of this action.

## Spell Evasion

**Specializations:** Finesse, Ranged, Unarmed

**Stamina Cost:** 1  
**Action Speed:** Reaction

Roll your evasion to resist a spell instead of making the normal resist roll. If the incoming spell grazes against your evasion roll, it is considered a failure instead. After you evade, you may move a distance up to half your speed or drop prone. If the spell targets an area, and you are still in the area at the end of free the move from evading, grazes are treats as normal instead.

## Spell Strike

**Specializations:** Finesse, Martial, Ranged, Unarmed

**Stamina Cost:** 1  
**Action Speed:** Standard

Make an attack. If successful, cast a spell with a range of touch and a speed of standard or faster against the same target. The target gets a -2 penalty to resist that spell. That spell is cast as a part of this attack (so its cast speed is ignored).
