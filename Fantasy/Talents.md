## Arcane Precision

**Cost:** 8 EXP  
**Requirements:** Max Intelligence 11+, Trained in Arcana or Sorcery

After rolling to cast a spell using the arcana or sorcery skill, you may increase its focus cost by 1 to reduce its spellcasting difficulty by 2. This ability can only be used a limited number of times per spell cast, as determined by the advancement of this ability.

##### Table: Arcane Precision Steps & Cost

## Arcane Synthesis

**Cost:** 8 EXP  
**Requirements:** Max Intelligence 11+, Trained in Arcana and Craft

Instead of making a craft check to craft a magic item, you may create an unstable version of that item as a swift action and by spending focus. Both the material cost of that item, and focus cost, are determined by the item created. Creating items in this way does not count as casting a spell. Items created using this talent must satisfy all other normal crafting requirements.

All items created by this ability lose their effects if not used before a week has passed since their creation.

The advancement of this talent determines what types of items can be created.

## Chaotic Magic

**Cost:** 8 EXP  
**Requirements:** Max Resolve 11+, Can cast spells

Before casting any spell you may choose to invoke the power of chaos, forcibly altering your spell. If you do, first choose your spell then roll r6 and use the following table to determine how it is altered. You may then make any choices for that spell.

You must attempt to cast the spell after rolling for the random effect. If you are unable to even begin casting the spell, considered it a failed spell that costs 1 focus, and end your turn (if during an encounter, and it is your turn).

## Divine Axiom

**Cost:** 8 EXP  
**Requirements:** Max Resolve 11+, Trained in Faith (Militarist), Trained in any combat skill

When you acquire this talent, pick Judgment or Protection. You may only acquire this talent once.

Depending on your choice, you may spend focus instead of stamina when performing certain maneuvers. If you picked Judgment, this applies to offensive maneuvers. If you picked Protection, then this applies to defensive maneuvers.

Performing a maneuver in this way costs focus equal to that maneuver's stamina cost plus 1, and gives you a +1 bonus to all rolls made with that maneuver. This talent can only be used to perform learned maneuvers, and not improvised maneuvers.

## Divine Devotion

**Cost:** 8 EXP  
**Requirements:** Max Resolve 11+, Trained in Faith

Before casting any spell using the faith skill, you may choose to request assistance from the divine in casting that spell. If you do, that spell has its difficulty reduced by 3. If that spell was provided to you as a bonus spell from your specialization, its difficulty is reduced by 5 instead, and the spell costs half the amount of focus (rounded up).

##### Table: Divine Devotion Steps & Cost
| Step Cost | Total Cost | Ability Uses |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 8 | 8 | 1/rest |
| 9 | 17 | 2/rest |
| 10 | 27 | 3/rest |
| 11 | 38 | 4/rest |

## Eldritch Infusion

**Cost:** 4 EXP  
**Requirements:** Max Intelligence 11+ or Max Resolve 11+, Can cast spells

The lowest degree of success that you can achieve with spells that both require concentration and that target yourself or your own equipment, is a graze instead of a fail. Additionally, if you get a critical success with one of those spells, refund half of its focus cost.

## Esoteric Will

**Cost:** 8 EXP  
**Requirements:** Max Resolve 11+, Can cast spells

You may pay costs to cast spells putting your focus into the negative. If you do, make a willpower check versus a difficulty equal to double your negative focus. Make this check after casting a spell in this way.

***Critical:*** Nothing bad happens.  
***Success:*** You lose 1 health.  
***Graze:*** You lose health equal to half that spell's focus cost (rounded up), and cannot cast the same spell until you take a short rest.  
***Fail:*** You lose health equal to that spell's focus cost, and cannot cast any spells until you take a long rest.

## Extra Spell

**Cost:** Variable  
**Requirements:** Can cast spells

When you acquire this talent you will learn a new spell for a spellcasting skill you already have. The highest tier spell you can learn with this talent is determined by the highest tier spell have learned from advancement. The cost to acquire this talent is determined by the tier of spell you learn.

This talent can be acquired any number of times.

##### Table: Extra Spells Cost
| Talent Cost | Tier | Tier Name |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 4 | 1 or 2 | Cantrip or Lesser |
| 8 | 3 or 4 | Greater or Heroic |

-->

## Magic Resistance

**Cost:** 8 EXP  
**Requirements:** Max Strength 11+, Max Resolve 13+

Whenever a spell that requires concentration is applying an effect to you, every round you can make an additional check to resist that spell. Additionally, you are always aware of the direction that a spell is coming from as it applies to you.

## Mental Balance

**Cost:** 8 EXP  
**Requirements:** Max Intelligence 13+, Can cast spells

You can maintain concentration on two spells instead of one.

## Metamagic

**Cost:** 8 EXP  
**Requirements:** Max Intelligence 13+ or Max Resolve 13+, Can cast at least 5 spells

When you acquire this talent you will choose a metamagic category from the table below. This talent can be taken multiple times (once for each category).

Before casting any spell, you may choose to modify it using any metamagic talents you have acquired. When you do, you must make adjustments to that spell to pay for the metamagic: a focus cost adjustment and a spellcasting difficulty adjustment. You will apply both of these adjustments, per each use of any metamagic.

Each spell you cast can be modified by metamagics a combined number of times equal to the total number of metamagic talents you have. Metamagics that reduce the focus cost or spellcasting difficulty can only be applied half this many times each (to a minimum of up to once), but still count toward the total. You may apply the same metamagic more than once in this way.

Spells cannot be adjusted by metamagics that change features they do not have, or to reduce those modifiers to zero. Similarly, spells cannot be adjusted simultaneously by metamagics that have opposite modifiers, like widened and reduced, for it would result in no change.

###### Table: Metamagic Categories & Modifiers
| Metamagic | Focus Cost<br/>Adjustment | Difficulty<br/>Adjustment | Modifier |
|:-|:-:|:-:|:-|
| Bloodied | -1 | +1 | The spell causes you to lose 1 health |
| Channelled | -1 | -1 | The spell is cast at one action speed slower (spells that are full-round or extended have their cast time doubled instead) |
| Empowered | +1 | +2 | The spell deals +2 damage or restores +2 endurance to each target (as per the spell) |
| Fickle | - | -1 | This spell has its duration halved (when you stack this metamagic it decreases from halved to thirded, then quartered, and so on) |
| Heightened | +1 | - | The spell gets +2 to its difficulty to resist |
| Intensified | +1 | +2 | The spell inflicts effects to a degree of one higher |
| Persistent | +1 | +2 | The spell has its duration doubled (when you stack this metamagic it increases from doubled to tripled, then quadrupled, and so on) |
| Quickened | +1 | +2 | The spell is cast at one action speed faster (spells that are extended have their cast time halved until they become full-round instead) |
| Reaching | +1 | +2 | The spell has its range doubled, or increased to 3m if it had a range of touch (when you stack this metamagic it increases from doubled to tripled, then quadrupled, and so on) |
| Reactive | +1 | +2 | The spell can be cast as a reaction if it has a speed of swift or faster |
| Reduced | - | -1 | This spell has its area or radius halved (when you stack this metamagic it decreases from halved to thirded, then quartered, and so on) |

| Widened | +2 | +2 | The spell has its area or radius doubled (when you stack this metamagic it increases from doubled to tripled, then quadrupled, and so on) |

## Steady Mind

**Cost:** 8 EXP  
**Requirements:** Max Intelligence 11+, Max Resolve 11+, Can cast spells

When you become unconscious, instead of immediately losing concentration on spells, you may make a willpower check against the difficulty to cast that spell. If successful, the spell is maintained.

## Wild Magic

**Cost:** 8 EXP  
**Requirements:** Max Resolve 11+, Can cast the spell Animal Form

Controlling the shape of an animal comes as easy to you as your natural born form. You no longer require concentration to maintain the spell Animal Form, and you may speak languages and cast spells while the spell is active.
