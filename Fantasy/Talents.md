## Esoteric Will

**Cost:** 10 EXP  
**Requirements:** Max Resolve 11+, Can cast spells

You may cast spells putting your mana into the negative. If you do, make a willpower check versus a difficulty equal to 1d12 plus your negative mana. Make this check after casting a spell in this way.

***Graze:*** You lose 1 health.  
***Fail:*** You lose 1d4 health, and cannot cast the same spell until you take a short rest.  
***Fumble:*** You lose 1d4+1 health, and cannot cast any spells until you take a long rest.

## Inherent Focus

**Cost:** 10 EXP
**Requirements:** Max Intelligence 11+, Max Resolve 11+, Can cast spells

When you become unconscious or stunned, instead of immediately losing concentration on spells, you may instead attempt to maintain concentration. If you do, roll as if you were casting that spell, and use the result to determine continued concentration. If this means rolling an opposed check against a target who is resisting that spell, roll with advantage.

## Magic Resistance

**Cost:** 10 EXP  
**Requirements:** Max Strength 11+, Max Resolve 13+

You get advantage to resist all non-damaging effects against spells that apply to you. Whenever a spell that requires concentration is applying an effect to you, every 6s (or 1 round) you can make an additional check to resist that spell. Additionally, you are always aware of the source of spells as they apply their effects to you, even when they would normally be hidden to you.

## Mental Balance

**Cost:** 8 EXP  
**Requirements:** Max Intelligence 13+, Can cast spells

You can control two spells that require concentration instead of one.
