## Arcane Precision

**Cost:** 10 EXP  
**Requirements:** Max Intelligence 11+, Can cast spells

After rolling to cast a spell, you may spend mana to decrease the difficulty value of that spell, at a cost of 1 mana per point of difficulty reduced. This additional mana spent is considered an increase on that spell's mana cost.

## Craft Preparation

**Cost:** Variable  
**Requirements:** Max Intelligence 11+, Trained in Craft

You always have craft materials available as long as you have your belongings, and all new crafts are made with partial progress for free.

##### Table: Craft Preparation Steps & Cost
| Step Cost | Total Cost | Free Progress |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 6 | 6 | 4% |
| 8 | 14 | 7% |
| 10 | 24 | 10% |

## Esoteric Will

**Cost:** 10 EXP  
**Requirements:** Max Resolve 11+, Can cast spells

You may cast spells putting your mana into the negative. If you do, make a willpower check versus a difficulty equal to double your negative mana. Make this check after casting a spell in this way.

***Graze:*** You lose 1 health.  
***Fail:*** You lose health equal to half that spell's mana cost, rounded up, and cannot cast the same spell until you take a short rest.  
***Fumble:*** You lose health equal to that spell's mana cost, and cannot cast any spells until you take a long rest.

## Inherent Focus

**Cost:** 8 EXP  
**Requirements:** Max Intelligence 11+, Max Resolve 11+, Can cast spells

When you become unconscious or stunned, instead of immediately losing concentration on spells, you may instead attempt to maintain concentration. If you do, roll as if you were casting that spell, and use the result to determine continued concentration.

## Magic Resistance

**Cost:** 8 EXP  
**Requirements:** Max Strength 11+, Max Resolve 13+

You get advantage to resist all non-damaging effects against spells that apply to you. Whenever a spell that requires concentration is applying an effect to you, every 6s (or 1 round) you can make an additional check to resist that spell. Additionally, you are always aware of the source of spells as they apply their effects to you, even when they would normally be hidden to you.

## Mental Balance

**Cost:** 8 EXP  
**Requirements:** Max Intelligence 13+, Can cast spells

You can control two spells that require concentration instead of one.

## Metamagic

**Cost:** 8 EXP  
**Requirements:** Max Intelligence 13+ or Max Resolve 13+, Can cast at least 5 spells

When you acquire this talent you will choose a metamagic category from the table below. This talent can be taken multiple times (once for each category).

Before casting any spell you may choose to modify how it is cast using any category of metamagic you have acquired. When you do, you may apply one of two adjustments to that spell to pay for the metamagic: a mana cost adjustment or a spellcasting difficulty adjustment. You will apply only one adjustment, not both, per use of metamagic.

Each spell you cast can be modified by metamagics a combined number of times equal to the total number of metamagic talents you have. Metamagics that reduce the mana cost or spellcasting difficulty can only be applied half this many times (to a minimum of up to once), but still count toward the total. You may apply the same metamagic more than once in this way.

###### Table: Metamagic Modifiers
| Metamagic | Mana Cost<br/>Adjustment | Difficulty<br/>Adjustment | Modifier |
|:-|:-:|:-:|:-|
| Alternate | +1 | +2 | The spell has different element and elemental effect (matching that element) than normal |
| Bloodied | –1 | –2 | The spell causes you to lose 2 health |
| Channelled | –1 | –2 | The spell is cast at one action speed slower (spells that are full-round or extended have their cast time doubled instead) |
| Empowered | +1 | +2 | The spell deals +1 damage to each target |
| Heightened | +1 | +2 | The spell gets +2 to its difficulty to resist |
| Intensified | +2 | +3 | The spell inflicts effects to a degree of one higher |
| Persistent | +2 | +3 | The spell has its duration doubled (when you stack this metamagic it increases from doubled to tripled, then quadrupled, and so on) |
| Quickened | +2 | +3 | The spell is cast at one action speed faster (spells that are extended have their cast time halved until they become full-round instead) |
| Reaching | +2 | +3 | The spell has its ranged doubled (when you stack this metamagic it increases from doubled to tripled, then quadrupled, and so on) |
| Triggered | +1 | +2 | The spell is cast, but its effects only occur when a specified trigger is met (holding this trigger requires concentration) |
| Widened | +2 | +3 | The spell has its area doubled (when you stack this metamagic it increases from doubled to tripled, then quadrupled, and so on) |

## Wild Magic

**Cost:** 8 EXP  
**Requirements:** Max Resolve 11+, Can cast spells

Before casting any spell you may choose to invoke the power of chaos, forcibly altering your spell. If you do, first choose your spell then roll r6 and use the following table to determine how it is changed. You must attempt to cast the spell after rolling for the random effect. If you are unable to even begin casting the spell, considered it a fumbled spell that costs 1 mana, and end your turn (if during an encounter, and it is your turn).

##### Table: Wild Magic Modifiers
| Roll | Modifier |
|:-:|:-|
| 6 | +2 to your spellcasting roll |
| 5 | The spell is considered one success category higher |
| 4 | The spell costs half mana, rounded up (after adjustments) |
| 3 | The spell is cast at one action speed faster (extended spells ignore this effect) |
| 2 | Cast the spell normally |
| 1 | –2 to your spellcasting roll |
