# Introduction

The **Modular Adventure Role-playing System** or **MARS** is a [generic role-playing system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_role-playing_game_system). One player (the *Game Master* or GM) describes the events that occur, while the other players (the *characters*) describe the actions they take. Difficult actions may require dice rolls to determine their success, with some tasks being more difficult than others. Like other roleplaying games that use dice, many of the rules outlined will use [common dice notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_notation). MARS can be played in various genres, and has optional variant rules to suit your group's playstyle.

# Learning to Play

All of the cores rules are defined in the [**MARS Basic: Player's Handbook**](https://github.com/lkodinsson/MARS/blob/main/Basic/PHB.md). Additional information and reference tables can be found in the [**MARS Basic: Appendix**](https://github.com/lkodinsson/MARS/blob/main/Basic/Appendix.md).

# Creating a Character

Once you have learned the rules and are ready to create a character, you will need to follow the steps as outlined in [**MARS Basic: Creating a Character**](https://github.com/lkodinsson/MARS/blob/main/Basic/PHB.md#creating-a-character).
