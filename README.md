# Introduction

The **Modular Adventure Role-playing System** or **MARS** is a [generic role-playing system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_role-playing_game_system). One player (the *Game Master* or GM) describes the events that occur, while the other players (the *characters*) describe the actions they take. Difficult actions may require dice rolls to determine their success, with some tasks being more difficult than others. Many roleplaying games typically use [dice notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_notation) to describe what dice to roll, while MARS uses a modified version of dice notation called [roll value](/Basic/PHB.md#roll-value).  MARS can be played in various genres, and has optional variant rules to suit your group's playstyle.

# Learning to Play

All of the cores rules are defined in the [**Player's Handbook**](/Basic/PHB.md). Additional information and reference tables can be found in the [**Appendix**](/Basic/Appendix.md).
