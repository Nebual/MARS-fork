## Epic Characters

The upper limit of power that characters can achieve is high enough to achieve most but not all difficulty challenge ratings with consistency. This way certain challenges can remain significantly difficult yet technically achievable by utilizing circumstance and advantage. However, if you really want to push the limit of the the characters, you can.  This is useful for adventures where you want characters to act more like gods or super heroes. It would also be appropriate to increase the amount of experience awarded to characters if you intend to make this power level more readily achievable.

Quite simply: double the awarded experience after every session, then use the extended advancement tables for Primary Stats and Skills below.
