# Professions

Typically adventurers make money by going on adventures. They do this by taking up specialized jobs that require their skillset, or by plundering loot from creatures or dangerous places. However, before an adventurer was an adventurer they likely had a job which they used to finance their new lifestyle. This is usually covered in a character's background or archetype, which also limits the types of jobs they can perform. This limitation is primarily for roleplaying and has little effect on the mechanical rewards of working for a wage.

At any point that a character has enough time to spend working they may make a skill check to see how much money they make. The type of skill used will depend on the type of job they are trying to perform. This is done on a case by case basis, but typically the player of that character wants to use their best skill to make money.

For example: A fighter wants to make money, so they go to the local barracks to spar with and train recruits. The fighter might use either their best combat skill or their charisma as the appropriate skill check.

The Game Master might also opt to skip the skill check entirely and just provide the player with some bonus money for roleplaying.

# Wages

Any money provided by working a real job is not going to be a lot of money compared to going on quests, heists, or any kind of adventure. Regardless, it can help fill in the gaps. Making money in this way is usually done over extended periods of time, and does not require a skill check. Instead you will use your average roll. To determine your average roll, take half your maximum roll, add any bonuses, then add 1 for every two dice you would roll.

The following values are calculated including any mandatory costs that a character might incur over a given period of time, such as food and shelter.

### Fantasy Wages

Wages in the fantasy genre are calculated per day, then extrapolated over the period of time that you character is working. How much you make per day is equal to your roll multiplied by 2, then subtracting 10 (to a minimum of 0). This is the total amount of money made in copper. Divide this by 10 to get that value in silver instead. Typically, you would only roll if you are getting paid for a single errand (such as performing in an inn). To remove the cost of living from the income calculation, don't subtract the 10 copper. For other circumstances, use your average roll.

The average person makes money assuming their average roll is a 7, while specialized workers would have an average roll of 10 to 14.

The following table provides examples at each difficulty breakpoint, rather than for all possible rolls:
