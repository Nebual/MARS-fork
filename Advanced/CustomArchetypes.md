# Custom Archetypes

Since archetypes are fundamentally a starting point they are easy to design yourself.

You can choose one of two different archetype loadouts: specialized or generalized. In either case you will pick five skills, at least two must be basic skills and at least two must be advanced skills. In a specialized loadout, one of those skills will be practiced (1d8), two will be adept (1d6), and two will be trained (1d4). In a generalized loadout, they will all be adept (1d6).

After deciding your starting skils you get one free talent that you meet the requirements for. If you picked Toughness as your free talent it starts advanced to +8. If you picked a talent with an experience cost of 6 or less, you get Toughness (+4) as well.

Although not quite as mechanical, it is also important to describe your archetype. What is the primary focus and environment for your archetype?
