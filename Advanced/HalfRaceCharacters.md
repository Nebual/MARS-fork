## Half-Race Characters

Rather than making characters from only a single racial lineage, you can also choose to create them using two races. Characters made this way are considered to be half of both of these races. You can write backstory for your character wherein they are more than two races, but mechanically you will be limited to two.

In a way this is like creating a custom race using two existing races as a template, using the following steps:

* Pick two races
* Pick two stats to get +1, but you can't pick a stat that one of the chosen races has a â€“1 in, unless the other race has a +2 to the same stat
* Pick a racial ability from one of those races
* Pick a size from one of those races (and add size adjustment to stats, if necessary)
* Take the average movement speed of the two races (rounded up)
* Start with the common language, and an additional language that is available to one of the two races chosen
