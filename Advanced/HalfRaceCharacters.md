## Half-Race Characters

Rather than making characters from only a single racial lineage, you can also choose to create them using two races. Characters made this way are considered to be half of both of these races. You can write backstory for your character wherein they are more than two races, but mechanically you will be limited to two.

In a way this is like creating a custom race using two existing races as a template, using the following steps:

* Pick two races
* Pick two stats to get +1 from among stats that those races have a +1 or higher
* Pick a racial ability from one of those races
* Pick a size ranging from one size smaller and larger than the average size (adding any size adjustment to stats as necessary)
* Pick one of those races and get all of their natural weapons (if any), then do the same for senses
* Take the average movement speed of the two races (rounded up)
* Start with the common language, and an additional language that is available to one of the two races chosen
