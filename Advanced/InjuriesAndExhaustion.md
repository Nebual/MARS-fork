# Injuries

Endurance and health are a numerical abstractions designed to simplify injuries. If this is not enough, more extreme measures can be applied. Injuries are basically permanent debilitations, and are applied to primary stats in the same way. A character can be both injured and debilitated effecting the same primary stat.

Whenever a character is reduced to zero or less health during an encounter, at the end of that encounter they become injured. The type of injury can be determined at random or by choice. Injuries can only be applied to primary stats that are not already injured. If a character already has all their stats effected by injuries, if they would get another they simply die instead.

Injuries can be recovered by resting for a long period of time ranging 9 to 12 months in-game time. Characters that assist in recovery of this can reduce this to half the time, but it is more challenging than treating normal wounds (against a difficulty of 14 instead of 10).

Special abilities that can remove debilitation can also remove injuries.

# Exhaustion

It is normally assumed that characters take a long rest each day, but if for some reason they don't, you may apply a penalty for doing so. Exhaustion are basically temporary debilitations, and are applied to primary stats in the same way. A character can be both exhausted and debilitated effecting the same primary stat. This functions very similar to injuries.

Whenever a character fails to take a long rest, they become exhausted. The type of exhaustion can be determined at random or by choice. Exhaustion can only be applied to primary stats that are not already exhausted. If a charater already has all of their stats effected by exhaustion, if they would get another they instead get a degree of sickness. This will eventually compound until the sickness starts to decrease their health and they die from a lack of rest.

When an exhausted character finally begins to take long rests, the process of exhaustion is reversed on step at a time. Per long rest, if the character has any degree of sickness from exhaustion, up to two degrees of sickness are removed. If that character is not sick, then it will instead remove one exhaustion that debilitates a primary stat.

Special abilities that can remove debilitation or sickness can remove exhaustion, but only ever one step at a time (as if they had rested).
