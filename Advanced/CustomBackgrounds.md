# Custom Backgrounds

If you have an intended backstory that does not correspond to a predetermined background you can design one for yourself.

Custom backgrounds are very simple to design. Primarily they require a description of no more than a few sentences. This determines the scope of what your character has done in their past, and what limits their knowledge skill. Then you pick two of any basic or core advanced skill to give a +1 bonus to, as they pertain to your background's description.

In the fantasy genre this extends to cover the [craft skill](/Fantasy/Skills.md#craft-int) as an additional core advanced skill.
