# Custom Backgrounds

If you have an intended backstory that does not correspond to a predetermined background then you can design one for yourself.

Custom backgrounds are very simple to design. Primarily they require a description of a few sentences. This determines the scope of what your character has done in their past, and what limits their knowledge skill.

Finally you pick two of any basic or core advanced skills to give a +1 bonus to, as they pertain to your background's description.
