## Currency

There are various types of currency that represent the money your character needs to spend on items and goods. The denominations of this currency are determined by their material. These materials are *copper*, *silver*, *electrum*, and *gold*. Each type of coin is worth ten times as much as the one before.

All characters start with 50 silver pieces which they can spend on starting equipment, in addition to some free adventuring gear (listed below).

##### Table: Currency
| Currency | Equivalent |
|:-|:-|
| 1 Silver (sp) | 10 Copper (cp) |
| 1 Electrum (ep) | 10 Silver (sp) |
| 1 Gold (gp) | 10 Electrum (ep) |

These denominations exist to add more flavour to roleplaying. Most prices of items are determined simply by their value in silver. Sometimes copper is used for very cheap items, or as a partial amount of silver.

<sup>2</sup>Toolkits contain all necessary tools to performing certain skillsets or crafts. When you buy a toolkit you must specify the skillset or craft it is for, rather than simply its size. For example, small toolkits could be used for cartography, cooking, fletching, jewelry making, lock picking, sewing, woodworking, and writing. Some skillsets require a larger amount of tools, such as alchemy, engineering, pottery, smithing, and trapmaking.

## Weapons

Weapons have several properties: *damage*, *critical bonus*, *type*, *weight*, and may have one or more *features*. Features provide special abilities to weapons to differentiate them from one another.

When attacking with a weapon that has multiple damage types, you must specify which one is being used during an attack.

### Improvised Weapons

Any object can be used as an improvised weapon. Objects that are similar enough to a normal weapon use the stats for that weapon, but have -1 to hit and damage. For other objects use the following table:

##### Table: Improvised Weapons
| Name | Damage | Crit | Type | Features |
|:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-|
| Rock or Gemstone | STR+r2 Blunt | +8 | Finesse/Ranged | Swift, Thrown 3m/40m |
| Shield or Dish | STR+r6 Blunt | +6 | Martial/Unarmed | Thrown 3m/30m |
| Potion | STR+r2 Blunt | +8 | Finesse/Ranged | Swift, Thrown 3m/30m |

Additionally, any weapon can also be thrown as if it has *Thrown 2m/20m*.

### Weapon Features

**Backswing** If you miss with this weapon, your next attack with it on the same target gets a +2 bonus to hit (ignoring the multiple attack penalty). This bonus does not stack.

**Bypass** Attacks made have a reduced threshold to get a critical equal to the given value.

**Cleave** Additional attacks made against new targets don’t suffer from the multiple attack penalty.

**Large** This weapon is treated as being unfit at 1m, but also is too large to make attacks while next to walls, ceilings, or obstacles within 1m (or more if they have the unfit feature). If used within a 1m range of friendly characters, you have a chance to hit them instead if you fail to hit your target (roll an attack with disadvantage to hit a random adjacent ally).

**Mechanical** This weapon does not add strength to damage, and can be preloaded before attacking with it.

**Momentum** This weapon gets +2 to damage against targets you have already hit during the same turn, including hits made with other weapons.

**Nonlethal** Enemies knocked unconscious by this weapon do not start dying unless severely injured (brought to negative health equal to their maximum).

**Parry** When you use this item to perform a parry action, add the given value to your Deflection.

**Ranged** Attacks made work normally up to the first given range. Attacks beyond that range get -1 to hit for each additional multiple of that range between you and the target. Attacks can only be made up to a maximum of the second given range. If only one range paramter is given, then that is also the maximum range. If used within a 1m range of friendly characters, you have a chance to hit them instead if you fail to hit your target (roll an attack with disadvantage to hit a random adjacent ally).

**Reach** Functions like the ranged feature, but attacks are still considered melee.

**Reload** Attacks can only be made by first taking the time to reload the weapon. Reloading the weapon in this way requires the use of both hands. Unless otherwise specified, it takes a swift action to reload the weapon, or a standard action if it is two-handed.

**Swift** Additional attacks made with this weapon have their multiple attack penalty reduced by 1 (from -4 to -3).

**Thrown** Attacks can be made as if they were ranged, but the weapon must then be retrieved after use.

**Trip** Attacks with this weapon can be made as a standard action that costs 1 stamina. That attack deals blunt damage, is made with -2 to hit, and deals half damage. If successful, the target can use agility to resist being tripped or drop prone.

**Two-Handed** Attacks may be made two-handed with an advantage to damage. Attacks made single-handed get -1 to hit, and a disadvantage to damage. Two-Handed ranged weapons cannot make attacks with one hand, and get no advantage to damage.

**Unfit** Attacks made at the given range or closer get -2 to hit.

**Versatile** Attacks may be made two-handed with an advantage to damage and -1 to hit. Attacks made single-handed are made normally.

## Armour

Weapons have several properties: *armour rating*, *damage reduction*, *strength requirement*, *armour slot*, *material type*, *weight*, and may have one or more *features*. Most features of armour are drawbacks of their design, but some of them provide bonuses.

**Critical Defense** Increase the threshold required to land a critical hit against you from an attack by 1.

**Guiding** You gain a +1 bonus to hit with non-mechanical projectile weapons.

**Limited Vision** You have a disadvantage to perception.

**Locking Grip** You have advantage against attempts to disarm.

**Noisy** Wearing any amount of noisy armour gives you disadvantage to agility while attempting to move silently.

**Parry** When you use this item to perform a parry action, add the given value to your deflection.

**Weak Back** Halve your total damage reduction provided by armour when attacked from behind.

**Weakness vs Type** Halve your total damage reduction provided by armour when attacked by the given damage type.

## Equipment Properties

Weapons and armour can also be given various properties, making them better or worse. Equipment may have up to two different properties simultaneously: *quality*, and *weight*. When determining which cost adjustment to use for the properties you have chosen for your item, always choose the most expensive options first. Apply any cost reductions last.

Only weapons and body armours can be given equipment qualities, and only melee weapons and body armour can have their weight adjusted. Shields and gauntlets can be given properties as if they were melee weapons.

##### Table: Equipment Qualities
| Quality Name | Weapons | Body Armour | Cost Adjustment |
