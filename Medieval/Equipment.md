# Currency

The denominations of currency are determined by their material. These materials are *copper*, *silver*, *electrum*, and *gold*. Each type of coin is worth ten times as much as the one before.

##### Table: Medieval Currency
| Currency | Equivalent |
|:-|:-|
| 1 Silver (sp)<sup>1</sup> | 10 Copper (cp) |
| 1 Electrum (ep) | 10 Silver (sp) |
| 1 Gold (gp) | 10 Electrum (ep) |

<sup>1</sup> Silver is the baseline currency, and most prices of items are determined simply by their value in silver. Sometimes copper is used for very cheap items, or as a partial amount of silver.

Glasses are optional, but free if your character has poor vision. Tracking use of food and water is optional.

<sup>2</sup> Toolkits contain all necessary tools to perform certain skillsets or crafts. When you buy a toolkit you must specify the skillset or craft it is for, rather than simply its size. For example, small toolkits could be used for cartography, cooking, fletching, jewelry making, lock picking, sewing, woodworking, and writing. Some skillsets require a larger amount of tools, such as alchemy, engineering, pottery, smithing, and trapmaking.

## Weapon Descriptions

**Battleaxe** Similar to a handaxe but with an extended handle and a heavier blade. It is still usable as a throwing weapon, but less effective than a handaxe. Alternate names for battleaxes include: *boarding axe*, *broadaxe*, *hafted axe*, *long axe*, *sagaris*, or *tabar*.

**Cestus** 

**Claws** 

**Club** A simple object designed for applying blunt trauma typically made out of wood. It is small and light enough to carry in one hand.

**Crossbow** Similar to a bow but utilizing mechanical action and mounted on a wooden base designed to help provide aim. They must either be armed by an external lever or be placed on the ground and held down by one's foot through front-mounted stirrup.

**Curved Longsword** Similar to a curved sword but featuring a longer blade. Alternate names for curved longswords includes: *chángdāo*, *grosse messer*, *long sabre*, *tachi*, *katana*, or *zhǎnmǎdāo*.

**Dagger** Similar to a knife, but designed more for use as a self-defense weapon given its light weight an ease of concealmeant. Alternate names for daggers include: *anelace*, *baselard*, *cinqueda*, *kopis*, *kris*, *kukri*, *pugio*, *qama*, or *tantō*.

**Darts** A thrown weapon resembling a large arrow but with a weight near to the front end to maintain inertia. Alternate names for darts include: *martiobarbuli* or *plumbata*.

**Dueling Sword** A long thin sword typically used as a self-defense weapon. Alternate names for dueling swords include: *basket-hilted sword*, *dueling sabre*, *rapier*, or *sidesword*.

**Flail** 

**Greataxe** A greataxe has an extended reach which makes it less like a normal axe and more like a poleaxe. While blades on some greataxes can get large, they do not get that much larger than a battleaxe. Alternate names for greataxes include: *bardiche*, *glaive*, *guāndāo*, or *lochaber*.

**Greathammer** 

**Greatsword** A sword of exceptionally large size. Alternate names for greatswords include: *bidenhänder*, *claymore*, *flammenschwert*, *kriegsmesser*, *nodachi*, *uchigatana*, or *zweihänder*.

Alternate names for large crossbows include: *arbalest*, *cranequin crossbow*, or *windlass crossbow*.

**Longbow** Similar to a shortbow but requiring more strength due to its larger size. It is capable of launching arrows much greater distances. Alternate names for longbows include: *warbow*

**Pike** Similar to a spear but with a substantially larger reach. This weapon is intended for use in large scale battles as it is effectively unusable in close quarters combat. Alternate names for pikes include: *ahlspiess*, *sarissa* or *xyston*.

**Poleaxe** A multi-purpose extended reach weapon with both a blade and a spike or a single blade on its far end. Alternate names for poleaxes include: *fauchard*, *guisarme*, *halberd*, *naginata*, *swordstaff*, and *voulge*.

**Shortspear** Similar to a spear but lacking the extended reach. Unlike a normal spear, a shortspear is also an effective throwing weapon. Alternate names for shortspears include: *assegai*, *bident*, *hasta*, *ranseur*, or *trident*.

**Sling** A cord with a small leather pouch that is swung in a wide rotation and then released to launch small projectiles large distances.

**Small Crossbow** Similar to a normal crossbow but of a smaller size. They are often either capable of arming without assistance or have a built in lever. They can be fired with one hand without a significant reduction in accuracy. Alternate names for small crossbows include: *hand crossbow*, *latchet crossbow*, or *lever crossbow*.

**Spear** A long reaching weapon with a pointed tip designed to threaten enemies at a distance slightly greater than the reach of most weapons. Altername names for spears include: *kontos*, *lance*, *partisan*, or *yari*.

**Spearclub** A reinforced club designed with a metal brace for greater impact force and a spike on top as an alternative method of applying injury. It is a very effective weapon for those who are not particularly combat trained.

**Thrusting Sword** Similar to a dueling sword but lacking a sharp edge, thrusting swords function similarly to thrusting daggers. Alternate names for thrusting swords include: *estoc*, *épée*, *foil*, or *koncerz*.

**Unarmed** 

**Warhammer** A reinforced hammer slightly larger than normal featuring a spike on its other side. Alternate names for warhammers include: *horseman's pick*, *nadziak*, or *warpick*.
