## Assassin

Rogues may have a bad reputation in some circles, but that's mostly the fault of assassins. It's not entirely without reason, however, as both assassins and rogues prefer to slink in the shadows. Assassins excel primarily at inflicting death. While this is true, they owe it to their medicinal knowledge. This type of knowledge allows them to prepare both poisons and antidotes.

**Skills** [Agility](/Basic/PHB.md#agility-dex) (r8), [Finesse](/Basic/PHB.md#finesse-dex) or [Ranged](/Basic/PHB.md#ranged-dex) (r6), [Perception](/Basic/PHB.md#perception-dex) (r4), [Medicine](/Basic/PHB.md#medicine-int) (r6), [Sleight](/Basic/PHB.md#sleight-dex) (r4)

**Primary Stat** Assassins must start with a maximum dexterity of 11 or greater.

## Berserker

While fighters might choose diplomacy, or paladins might seek to protect their allies, berserkers live for combat above all else. Berserkers can harness the power of pure rage in combat to deliver powerful blows and shrug off pain. Typically, those who might call themselves berserkers are those from more tribal militaristic societies, or those who engage in the sport of fighting others like gladiators.

## Fighter

No matter the reason, either to defend the weak, for honor, for glory, or for revenge, fighters are skilled in the arts of combat and warfare. Through the use of various combat maneuvers, fighters are vital to winning various conflicts of physical prowess. Although fighters are primarily combatants, they are also often skilled in the application of medicine and diplomacy.

## Magister

The might of the magister sits deep within their mind, for above all else a magister is educated. Magisters dedicate themselves to preparing for both the known and unknown. If there is a task that someone else cannot complete, the magister is likely to be capable of providing the means.

**Skills** [Craft](/Basic/PHB.md#craft-int) (r6), [Knowledge](/Basic/PHB.md#knowledge-int) (r8), [Medicine](/Basic/PHB.md#medicine-int) (r6), [Perception](/Basic/PHB.md#perception-dex) (r4), [Sleight](/Basic/PHB.md#sleight-dex) (r4)

## Rogue

The world is full of dangers and unknowns. Rogues live and breathe in the world of peril, prepared to fight back with sharp wits or sharp blades. They are particularly known for their ability to tamper with various devices, such as traps and locks. It is likely that they are great thieves and smugglers, but it wouldn't be safe to say it to their faces.
