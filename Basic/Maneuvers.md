## Poisonous Strike

**Specializations:** Finesse, Ranged

**Stamina Cost:** 2  
**Action Speed:** Standard

**Duration:** 1 Turn  
**Resist:** Fortitude (for reduced effect)

Make an attack with a weapon. If successful, make a medicine check to inflict sickness 3 upon the target, or sickness 1 if the target resists. This causes it to perform tasks worse and suffer loss of health over a short period of time. Whenever the duration of this effect is met, the target may resist the sickness. If they fail, they lose 2 health, otherwise reduce the degree of effect of the sickness by 1 and they lose 1 health instead.

If this effect is applied to a target that is already effected by this kind of poison, the greatest degree of effect takes precedence.

Instead of performing this maneuver, you may also make a medicine check to pre-apply a single use poison to a weapon that inflicts the same effect. This determines the difficulty (in advance) to resist that poison.

Performing this maneuver, or pre-applying a poison, can only be done with access to a pre-made poison, or materials that can be used to approximate a poison.

Additionally, they must target you with at least one action (if possible) on their next turn.

## Shield Bash

**Specializations:** Martial, Unarmed

**Stamina Cost:** 1  
**Action Speed:** Swift

**Resist:** Fortitude

Make an attack with a shield or similar item as if it was a weapon that deals r8 blunt damage and +6 crit damage. If successful, the target is knocked back 1m. If they can't be knocked back because there is not enough room, then gain advantage to your damage roll.
