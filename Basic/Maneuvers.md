**Duration:** 1 Turn  
**Resist:** Fortitude (for reduced effect)

Make an attack with a weapon. If successful, make a medicine check to inflict sickness 3 upon the target, or sickness 1 if the target resists. This causes it to perform tasks worse and suffer loss of health over a short period of time. Whenever the duration of this effect is met, the target may resist the sickness. If they fail, they lose 2 health, otherwise reduce the degree of effect of the sickness by 1 and they lose 1 health instead.

If this effect is applied to a target that is already effected by this kind of poison, the greatest degree of effect takes precedence.

Instead of performing this maneuver, you may also make a medicine check to pre-apply a single use poison to a weapon that inflicts the same effect. This determines the difficulty (in advance) to resist that poison.

Performing this maneuver, or pre-applying a poison, can only be done with access to a pre-made poison, or materials that can be used to approximate a poison.

**Resist:** Willpower

Make a charisma check against a target within 20m.

Additionally, they must target you with at least one action (if possible) on their next turn.

## Quick Reload

**Type:** Tactical  
**Specializations:** Ranged

**Stamina Cost:** 1  
**Action Speed:** Free

The next time you take the reload action this turn, it is one action speed faster. If reloading is an extended action, it takes half the amount of time instead. If reducing an extended action by half would make it shorter than or equal to six seconds, it becomes a full-round action instead.

## Shield Crush

**Type:** Offensive  
**Specializations:** Martial, Unarmed

**Stamina Cost:** 1  
**Action Speed:** Swift

**Resist:** Fortitude

Make an attack with a shield or similar item as if it was a weapon that deals r6 blunt damage and +6 crit damage. If successful, the target is knocked back 1m. If they can't be knocked back because there is not enough room, then gain advantage to your damage roll.
