## Bear

Very large beast  
**CR:** 4

They are twice as large as the average humanoid. Since they are very strong, fast, and durable, it would not be wise to pick a fight with this creature. Since they are actually pretty smart and not overtly aggressive it isn't likely they would pick a fight with you either. They absolutely will fight back if antagonized.
