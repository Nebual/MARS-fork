## Bear

Very large beast  
**CR:** 4

They are twice as large as the average humanoid. Since they are very strong, fast, and durable, it would not be wise to pick a fight with this creature. Since they are actually pretty smart and not overtly aggressive it isn't likely they would pick a fight with you either. They absolutely will fight back if antagonized or if they feel that their territory is threatened.

## Bird, raptor

Very small beast  
**CR:** ¾

These flying creatures are bigger and faster than you might expect. While their smaller cousins are timid and weak, these creatures can cause serious damage if they can find the right opportunity. Since they can see very large distances away and can fly to meet their prey, it is likely they will get that opportunity if they wait for it.

## Wolf

Medium beast  
**CR:** 1¾

These creatures are truly pack animals at heart. While it is not rare to find them alone, it is much more likely that they are found in groups led by their eldest family member. As a group they are more fearless than on their own.

**HP** 13, **EP** 18, **SP** 15

**Speed** 13m

**Low-light vision** Wolves can see in both daylight and poorly lit areas. While in the dark, they are sensitive to bright lights.
**Natural armour, hide (+1/+2)** Wolves have a rough hide that acts like armour, providing them with an AC of 1 and a DR of 3 (weakness vs piercing/slashing)
