# Bestiary

The bestiary is a collection of various pre-generated non-player characters and creatures. It is useful for anyone who immediately needs stats for a character or creature and doesn't want to spend the time generating all their stats manually.

Creatures are given a description to use as a tool when roleplaying. Only characters who are likely to know the exact nature of a creature should be immediately aware of more intimate details. Sometimes this is unavoidable for players very familiar with role-playing games. Other useful details are provided for the Game Master's use to help provide additional world building details when using any given creature, such as habitat and behaviour.

Creatures are also given a list of stats and skills. It is important to note that unlike most other role-playing systems slaying enemy characters and creatures does not award experience points, so experience rewards are not listed among their stats.

### Stat and Skill Ratings

Stats and skills will also be given *ratings*, which are approximations of the average value that stat or skill can roll. This is useful to save time when you need an immediate value to compare against, but don't want to spend additional time rolling dice (such as for a group of creatures). Ratings are listed before the actual value of a skill or stat, separated by a slash. They can be calcuated by finding the maximum value that skill's dice and associated stat can roll, dividing that value in half, then adding any bonuses and or penalties.

### Combat Rating

This stat is represented by a single number. This number is a comparative value between the combat effectiveness of a creature and the combat effectiveness of a character. Newly created characters are expected to be rated at a value of 1 to 2, with much more experienced characters reaching as high as 20.

You can find the combat rating of any character or creature by finding three specific values, then multiplying them together:

Health pool and damage rating: (Maximum strength + maximum endurance) รท 20  
Offense rating: (Highest combat or spellcasting skill rating) รท 10  
Defense rating: (Highest of deflection rating or evasion rating + damage reduction) รท 10

A value of 1 is found by assuming all stats are average, a combat skill with a value of 1d10, any basic weapon, and wearing a piece of armour with a combined armour class and damage reduction of 5.

Challenging combat encounters have equivalent combat ratings on both sides. Some powerful creatures may have combat ratings much higher than what a single player can achieve alone.

### Commons and Elites

The status of a particular creature modifies certain characteristics about it. All of the resource stats (health, endurance, stamina, and mana) will have two listed values: the first value is for common creatures, and the second listed value (in parentheses) are for elite creatures. Common creatures will have these stats reduced to half. Combat ratings are also given two values in the same way. Additionally, any special abilities and actions (such as maneuvers and spells), are to be used sparingly (if at all) by common creatures.

# Creating Creatures

Imagine how you would describe that creature, then assign values to its stats and skill based on your desriptions. Use the names of dice steps to help you decide what it should have. Because you are using description to determine the exact features of a creature, you don't need to limit yourself to normal character building or advancement rules. Use them as a baseline, however, so that they still function as you would expect from any other character. Try to avoid directly adding modifers to stats and skills, use dice steps instead.
