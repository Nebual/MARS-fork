# Bestiary

The bestiary is a collection of various pre-generated non-player characters and creatures. It is useful for anyone who immediately needs stats for a character or creature and doesn't want to spend the time generating all their stats manually. Entries in the bestiary are made up of a few parts: *description*, *stat block*, *actions*, and *items*.

## Description

Creatures are given a description to use as a tool when roleplaying. Only characters who are likely to know the exact nature of a creature should be immediately aware of more intimate details. Sometimes this is unavoidable for players very familiar with role-playing games. Other useful details are provided for the Game Master's use to help provide additional world building details when using any given creature, such as habitat and behaviour.

## Stat Block

This is a direct reference to all of the statistics and values that are necessary to using the creature. Stats and skills will also be given *ratings*, which are representative of the average value that stat or skill can roll. This is useful to save time when you need an immediate value to compare against, but don't want to spend additional time rolling dice (such as for a group of creatures). Ratings are listed before the actual value of a skill or stat, separated by a slash. They can be calcuated by finding the maximum value that skill's dice and associated stat can roll, dividing that value in half, then adding any bonuses and or penalties.

It is important to note that unlike most other role-playing systems slaying enemy characters and creatures does not award experience points, so experience rewards are not listed on bestiary entries. Experience points are awarded at the end of gameplay sessions based on objectives met during that session (which may include the killing of enemies).

### Combat Rating

This stat is represented by a single number. This number is a comparative value between the combat effectiveness of this creature, and the combat effectiveness of a someone specialized for fighting. Newly created characters are expected to be rated at about a value of 1, while much more experience characters might cap at about a rating of 2 or 2½. New characters weak in combat potential might be rated at ¾.

This number is calculated by adding the maximum strength, the rating of their highest combat (or spellcasting) skill, and maximum endurance, and diving the total by 30. The resulting decimal value is converted to a rounded fraction for readability. Common creatures have their combat rating halved, as they have very few special abilities.

Challenging combat encounters have equivalent combat ratings on both sides. Some powerful creatures may have combat ratings much higher than what a single player can achieve alone.

## Actions

Typically creatures will have one or more categories of actions listed, such as: *common actions*, and *rare actions* (which may include maneuvers, spells, or some other category if approriate). The majority of creatures that you find will only use common actions. If the creature used is of significant importantance they can be made to stand out by giving them use of their rare actions.

## Items

Most occurences of a given creature will have on them any items listed, but this is not a strict rule. Due to the circumstances of your adventure this can (and should) be modified as approriate.

# Creating Creatures

Quite simply, just imagine how you would describe that creature, then assign values to its stats and skill based on your desriptions. Use the names of dice steps to help you decide what it should have. Because you are using description to determine the exact features of a creature, you don't need to limit yourself to normal character building or advancement rules. Use them as a baseline, however, so that they still function as you would expect from any other character. Try to avoid directly adding modifers to stats and skills, use dice steps instead.

## Common and Elite enemies

The status of a particular creature determines certain characteristics about it. Common creatures have half the normal health and endurance, and get access to a very limited selection of special abilities, if any at all. They exist to provide context against more powerful creatures: *elites*. Only the most powerful of creatures are considered elites. Elite creatures will often have several special abilities and exceptional stats and skills.

# Converting from d20

Most role-playing material available is created for popular d20 game systems. The following are some guidelines to converting the numerical properties of that material so they can be used with MARS.

## Skill Checks

To convert skill checks from d20 challenges, multiply them by 0.8 (round down or up as applicable). If the result is less than 5, then the check is trivial and requires no roll. This is only necessary if the challenge doesn't conform to an example listed under each skill (or can't be otherwise logically determined).

## Weapons & Armour

Items in d20 systems typically get increasing modifiers, these modifiers get converted to equipment properties instead. Alternate item materials go through the same process.

##### Table: d20 Equipment Conversion
| D20 | Equivalent |
|:-|:-|
| Masterwork | Fine |
| +1, +2 | Superior |
| +3, +4 | Exceptional |
| +5 | Masterwork |
| Adamantine | Heavy & Fine |
| Cold Iron | Heavy |
| Copper | Crude |
| Darkwood | Fine |
| Mithral | Light & Fine |
| Stone | Heavy & Crude |
| Wood | Improvised |

## Characters and Creatures

This is probably the most difficult part to convert. In the case of characters you can convert the primary stats, but most class features aren't as easy.

##### Table: d20 Stat Conversion
| d20 | MARS |
|:-|:-|
| Base STR | STR Step equivalent |
| Base DEX | DEX Step equivalent |
| Base INT | INT Step equivalent |
| Base (CON + WIS) ÷ 2 | RES Step equivalent |

##### Table: d20 Stat Step Equivalent
| d20 | Dice Step | Step Name |
|:-:|:-:|:-|
| 1~3 | 1d4 | Fragile |
| 4~6 | 1d6 | Weak |
| 7~9 | 1d8 | Below Average |
| 10~11 | 1d10 | Average |
| 12~14 | 1d12 | Above Average |
| 15~17 | 1d10+1d4 | Great |
| 18~20 | 1d10+1d6 | Superb |
| 21~24 | 1d10+1d8 | Powerful |
| 25+ | 2d10 | Epic |

After determining these, apply the most appropriate race, background, and archetype. Advance the character until it meets similar thresholds. [Skill Ratings](#stat-block) are good baselines for similar features found in d20 systems.

##### Table: d20 Rating Equivalents
| d20 | Equivalent |
|:-|:-|
| (Base Attack Bonus + 10) × ⅔ | Combat skill rating |
| (Caster Level + 10) × ⅔ | Spellcasting skill rating |
| (Any skill rank + 10) × ⅔ | Closest equivalent skill rating |

In general, average d20 characters will be stronger than average MARS characters.
