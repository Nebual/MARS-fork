# Worldbuilding

A major part of being a game master is being prepared to present an entire world to the players. This can be a lot of work, especially when players may choose to completely subvert your setup. Regardless of your degree of preparation, below there is a framework for building content for players. This can be a useful tool when you need to improvise content.

Each type of content listed will also be given a list of questions to ask. These questions are useful for quickly providing answers for the types of actions your players will take when presented with the information contained therein the given situations.

### Storyline Emblems

### Scenarios

Scenarios are a complete statement representing a conflict or call-to-action for players. These can be complicated or simple descriptions of events that are happening in your world.

Example: A village is having their farms raided by nearby monsters, and they are in need of assistance if they are to continue feeding their population.

It is important not to decide in the framing of your scenario exactly how it is to be resolved by the players. This is an important distinction to remember, as players may surprise you in how they decide to solve or complete your proposed scenarios. Having multiple scenarios prepared can be useful if players intend to compeltely subvert your originally planned scenario.

#### Scenarios: Questions

* What notable characters or entities exist that can provide more information for players?
* What are the consequences if the scenario is resolved with violence? What about diplomacy?
* Are there any other ways to resolve the scenario?
* Where can the players go if they completely subvert the scenario?

### Scenes

When players are actively engaging with the world and exploring the scenario provided to them, they are considered in a scene. This is where players can engage with non-player characters to gather information, explore potentially dangerous areas, and enter into encounters with enemies. Scenes are expected to have their own challenges which, while being potential roadblocks, must all have solutions for the players to overcome. Although it can be nice to provide details to add depth to the world before your players, players will typically expect any details given to be given for the reason of intentional interaction.

Example: There is a room with a locked door. The players know that there is something behind this door they want. The door can be broken into, lock picked, or you can break into the room by climbing into the window from the outside. There is also a key to the door hidden in the room.

#### Scenes: Questions

* Where is the scene taking place?
* Are there any details about the environment that are important?
* What are the consequences if the scene is resolved with violence? What about diplomacy?
* Are there any other ways to resolve the scene?
* How can the scenario progress if the scene is failed or subverted?

# Bestiary

The bestiary is a collection of various pre-generated non-player characters and creatures. It is useful for anyone who immediately needs stats for a character or creature and doesn't want to spend the time generating all their stats manually.

Creatures are given a description to use as a tool when roleplaying. Only characters who are likely to know the exact nature of a creature should be immediately aware of more intimate details. Sometimes this is unavoidable for players very familiar with role-playing games. Other useful details are provided to help Game Masters with world building when using any given creature, such as habitat and behaviour.

Creatures are also given a list of stats and skills. It is important to note that unlike most other role-playing systems, slaying enemy characters and creatures does not award experience points, so experience rewards are not listed among their stats.

### Stat and Skill Ratings

Stats and skills will also be given *ratings*, which are approximations of the average value that stat or skill can roll. This is useful to save time when you need an immediate value to compare against, but don't want to spend additional time rolling dice (such as for a group of creatures). Ratings are listed before the actual value of a skill or stat, separated by a slash. They can be calculated by finding the maximum value that skill's dice and associated stat can roll, dividing that value in half, then adding any bonuses and or penalties.

Whenever you need to roll for a group of creatures you can either take the given rating for that roll, then adjust it plus or minus 1 until you have provided a roll for each creature, or you can roll then do the same. For example: You have a group of creatures that all need an initiative roll, so you roll their initiative and get a value of 6. You can then assign them values of 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as their rolls.

Advantage and disadvantage on rolls can also be approximated. For the first degree of advantage or disadvantage, add or subtract, respectively, a number equal to the amount of dice. For each additional degree, add or subtract that many reduced by 1, until you are only left adjusting by 1. For example: if you would roll 3 dice for a creature's skill check, but they have advantage, add 3. If that creature had triple advantage, add 3+2+1, for a total of 6. If that creature only rolled 2 dice, instead add 2+1+1, for a total of 5.

### Challenge Rating (CR)

This stat is represented by a single number. This number is a comparative value between the combat effectiveness of a creature and the combat effectiveness of a character. Newly created characters are expected to be rated at a challenge rating of 1 to 2, with much more experienced characters reaching as high as 20.

You can find the combat rating of any character or creature by finding three specific values, then multiplying them together:

Health pool and damage rating: (Maximum health + maximum endurance) ? 20  
Offense rating: (Highest combat or spellcasting skill rating) ? 10  
Defense rating: (Highest of deflection rating or evasion rating + damage reduction) ? 10

A challenge rating of 1 is found by assuming all stats are average (r10), a proficiency in a combat skill (r10), any basic weapon, and wearing a piece of armour with a combined armour class and damage reduction of 5.

Challenging combat encounters have equivalent combat ratings on both sides. Some powerful creatures may have combat ratings much higher than what a single player can achieve alone.

### Creature Rarity

The rarity of a particular creature modifies certain characteristics about it. All of the resource stats (health, endurance, stamina, and mana) will have three listed values. Challenge ratings are also given multiple values. These values, in order, represent that values you should use with those creatures depending on how notable, or rare, that creature is. The names for these rarities are: *common*, *elite*, and *unique*. Common creatures aren't particularly notable, so use their special abilities sparingly if at all.

# Creating Creatures

Imagine how you would describe that creature, then assign values to its stats and skill based on your descriptions. Use the names of dice steps to help you decide what it should have. Because you are using description to determine the exact features of a creature, you don't need to limit yourself to normal character building or advancement rules. Use them as a baseline, however, so that they still function as you would expect from any other character. Try to avoid directly adding modifers to stats and skills, use dice steps instead. If you do feel the need to manually add modifiers to stats, you can give them +1 to two stats, or +2, +1 and -1 among three stats.
