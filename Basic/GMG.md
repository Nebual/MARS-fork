# Bestiary

The bestiary is a collection of various pre-generated non-player characters and creatures. It is useful for anyone who immediately needs stats for a character or creature and doesn't want to spend the time generating all their stats manually.

Creatures are given a description to use as a tool when roleplaying. Only characters who are likely to know the exact nature of a creature should be immediately aware of more intimate details. Sometimes this is unavoidable for players very familiar with role-playing games. Other useful details are provided for the Game Master's use to help provide additional world building details when using any given creature, such as habitat and behaviour.

Creatures are also given a list of stats and skills. It is important to note that unlike most other role-playing systems slaying enemy characters and creatures does not award experience points, so experience rewards are not listed among their stats.

### Stat and Skill Ratings

Stats and skills will also be given *ratings*, which are approximations of the average value that stat or skill can roll. This is useful to save time when you need an immediate value to compare against, but don't want to spend additional time rolling dice (such as for a group of creatures). Ratings are listed before the actual value of a skill or stat, separated by a slash. They can be calcuated by finding the maximum value that skill's dice and associated stat can roll, dividing that value in half, then adding any bonuses and or penalties.

### Combat Rating

This stat is represented by a single number. This number is a comparative value between the combat effectiveness of a creature and the combat effectiveness of a character. Newly created characters are expected to be rated at a value of 1 to 1½, with much more experienced characters reaching as high as 20.

You can find the combat rating of any character or creature by finding three specific values, then multiplying them together:

Health pool and damage rating: (Maximum strength + maximum endurance) ÷ 20  
Offense rating: (Highest combat or spellcasting skill rating) ÷ 10  
Defense rating: (Highest of deflection rating or evasion rating + damage reduction) ÷ 10

A value of 1 is found by assuming all stats are average, a combat skill with a value of 1d10, any basic weapon, and wearing a piece of armour with a combined armour class and damage reduction of 5.

Challenging combat encounters have equivalent combat ratings on both sides. Some powerful creatures may have combat ratings much higher than what a single player can achieve alone.

# Creating Creatures

Imagine how you would describe that creature, then assign values to its stats and skill based on your desriptions. Use the names of dice steps to help you decide what it should have. Because you are using description to determine the exact features of a creature, you don't need to limit yourself to normal character building or advancement rules. Use them as a baseline, however, so that they still function as you would expect from any other character. Try to avoid directly adding modifers to stats and skills, use dice steps instead.

##### Table: All Stat Steps
| Dice Step | Stat Step | Skill Step |
|:-:|:-|:-|
| 1d4 | Fragile | Trained |
| 1d6 | Weak | Adept |
| 1d8 | Below Average | Practiced |
| 1d10 | Average | Proficient |
| 1d12 | Above Average | Exceptional |
| 1d10+1d4 | Great | Disciplined |
| 1d10+1d6 | Superb | Accomplished |
| 1d10+1d8 | Powerful | Expert |
| 2d10 | Epic | Expert | Master |
| 1d12+1d10 | Heroic | Prodigy |
| 2d10+1d4 | Fantastic | Virtuoso |
| 2d10+1d6 | Fabled | Renowned |
| 2d10+1d8 | Mythical | Exalted |
| 3d10 | Legendary | Grandmaster |

## Commons and Elites

The status of a particular creature determines certain characteristics about it. Common creatures have half the normal resources (health, endurance, stamina, and mana), and get access to a very limited selection of special abilities, if any at all. Elite creatures will often have several special abilities and exceptional stats and skills.

# Converting from d20

Most role-playing material available is created for popular d20 game systems. The following are some guidelines to converting the numerical properties of that material so they can be used with MARS.

## Skill Checks

To convert skill checks from d20 challenges, multiply them by 0.8 (round down or up as applicable). If the result is less than 5, then the check is trivial and requires no roll. This is only necessary if the challenge doesn't conform to an example listed under each skill (or can't be otherwise logically determined).

## Characters and Creatures

This is probably the most difficult part to convert. In the case of characters you can convert the primary stats, but most class features aren't as easy.

##### Table: d20 Stat Conversion
| d20 | MARS |
|:-|:-|
| Base STR | STR Step equivalent |
| Base DEX | DEX Step equivalent |
| Base INT | INT Step equivalent |
| Base (CON + WIS) ÷ 2 | RES Step equivalent |

##### Table: d20 Stat Step Equivalent
| d20 | Dice Step | Step Name |
|:-:|:-:|:-|
| 1~3 | 1d4 | Fragile |
| 4~6 | 1d6 | Weak |
| 7~9 | 1d8 | Below Average |
| 10~11 | 1d10 | Average |
| 12~14 | 1d12 | Above Average |
| 15~17 | 1d10+1d4 | Great |
| 18~20 | 1d10+1d6 | Superb |
| 21~24 | 1d10+1d8 | Powerful |
| 25+ | 2d10 | Epic |

After determining these, apply the most appropriate race, background, and archetype. Advance the character until it meets similar thresholds. [Skill ratings](#stat-and-skill-ratings) are good baselines for similar features found in d20 systems.

##### Table: d20 Rating Equivalents
| d20 | Equivalent |
|:-|:-|
| (Base Attack Bonus + 10) × ⅔ | Combat skill rating |
| (Caster Level + 10) × ⅔ | Spellcasting skill rating |
| (Any skill rank + 10) × ⅔ | Closest equivalent skill rating |

In general, average d20 characters will be stronger than average MARS characters.

## Equipment

Items in d20 systems typically get increasing modifiers, these modifiers get converted to equipment properties instead. Alternate item materials go through the same process.

##### Table: d20 Equipment Conversion
| D20 | Equivalent |
|:-|:-|
| Masterwork | Fine |
| +1, +2 | Superior |
| +3, +4 | Exceptional |
| +5 | Masterwork |
| Adamantine | Heavy & Fine |
| Cold Iron | Heavy |
| Copper | Crude |
| Darkwood | Fine |
| Mithral | Light & Fine |
| Stone | Heavy & Crude |
| Wood | Improvised |

Any wealth that a d20 character has is typically measured in gold. For each type of currency that a d20 character has, move it down two currency types; any silver and copper they had is gone, gold becomes silver, and platinum becomes electrum.
