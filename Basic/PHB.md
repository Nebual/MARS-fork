# The Basics

MARS features many similarities to other role-playing game systems. You will control a character that is defined by several abstract features. These features are called *stats*, *skills*, *talents*, and *traits*. Stats and skills are represented by dice or numbers, while talents and traits represent special abilities or actions that a character can perform. As players progress they will be awarded experience points that they can spend to improve the stats and skills of their character, or to acquire new talents.

As a player you will interact inside a world controlled by a Game Master who determines certain properties about the world, such as the genre and setting. The genre of a world determines a lot of its core features like what types of abilities characters can use, what types of characters you will expect to play as and interact with, and what type of technology is present in that world.

### Roll Value

Most roleplaying games typically use [dice notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_notation) to describe what dice to roll. MARS uses a modified version of dice notation called *roll value*. Some characteristics or numbers may be represented by this roll value. The main difference in this notation is that while common dice notation will specify exactly what dice to roll, and roll value is more of a shorthand representation. Normal dice notation may become long and complicated, such as: *2d10+1d6+1d4+1*. This is difficult to read, so roll value is designed to be shorter, easier to read, and represent a whole group of dice to roll.

Roll value will typically have one or two numbers: *r14+1*. The first number following the *r* represents the roll value, and therefore what dice to roll, and the second value represents a numerical modifier as a plus or minus. Basically, you count the number of tens in the roll value, then roll that many ten-sided-dice. Any remainder left over is rolled as a die of that size.

For example: A roll value of 14 would be a ten-sided-die and a four-sided-die, while a roll value of r20 would be two ten-sided-dice.

There is only one exception to interpreting roll value, which is that if you get a remainder of 2, then you upgrade one of those ten-sided-dice to a twelve-sided-die.

For example: A roll value of 22 would be a ten-sided-die and a twelve-sided-die.

Whenever you add multiple roll values together, they merge into a combined roll value: *r14* plus *r8* equals *r22*.

Below is a table for visualization (with a more full table available in the [appendix](/Basic/Appendix.md#roll-values)):

| Roll Value | Dice to Roll | Number of Dice |
|:-:|:-|:-:|
| r4 | 1d4 | 1 |
| r6 | 1d6 | 1 |
| r8 | 1d8 | 1 |
| r10 | 1d10 | 1 |
| r12 | 1d12 | 1 |
| r14 | 1d10+1d4 | 2 |
| r16 | 1d10+1d6 | 2 |
| r18 | 1d10+1d8 | 2 |
| r20 | 2d10 | 2 |
| r22 | 1d12+1d10 | 2 |
| r24 | 2d10+1d4 | 3 |
| r26 | 2d10+1d6 | 3 |
| r28 | 2d10+1d8 | 3 |
| r30 | 3d10 | 3 |

Roll values can also be estimated using what is called a *passive value*, which is equal to half of the roll value, plus or minus any modifiers. This value is always slightly below your average expected roll, making it a useful tool for estimating what you can expect to roll above.

### Stats

Stats represent the innate capabilities of a character. There are two types of stats: *primary stats* and *secondary stats*. Primary stats are represented by a roll value, and represent how well a character can perform universal tasks. Secondary stats are represented by either a roll value or flat numbers and are more specific properties of a character. While primary stats are something a character simply has, secondary stats are derived from other sources (such as primary stats).

### Skills

Skills represent what your character is practiced in. Like primary stats, skills are represented by a roll value. The two types of skills are *basic skills* and *complex skills*. Basic skills are tasks that anyone can perform, while complex skills can only be performed by characters that are at least trained in that skill. Some of the complex skills that a character can learn depend on the genre you are playing in. While someone who can cast spells might be more typical of a fantasy genre, it would not be as common in a modern genre.

### Talents

Talents are powerful abilities that characters can learn. They usually provide you the ability to perform unique actions that are not simple enough to be performed by skills, or are modifiers to how a character performs their normal abilities. Most talents that can be acquired are dependant on the type of genre you are playing (similar to complex skills).

### Traits

Traits are unique abilities that usually only belong to a single character. They are often an ability that a character can perform, or something they have that affects their life. They are opportunities to roleplay in a way that uniquely fits your character and help them differentiate from other characters that would otherwise be very similar to them.

# Playing the Game

Typically game sessions go as follows: the Game Master describes the scene, the players describe their actions, the Game Master describes the results of those actions, and then the game progresses to the next scene. Through the act of description and exposition, your characters and the world they inhabit become alive.

It is important to focus more on describing what it is your character does, rather than declaring the exact game action your character takes. It is more up to the Game Master to decide what actual game actions you perform, or what skill is required to overcome a challenge. This provides more freedom to narrate your character's intentions, rather than strictly adhering to gamified actions like a traditional board game.

While describing what your character does, try not to detail the results of your character's actions, only the actions themselves. Dice may be rolled to determine the outcome of that action if the outcome is uncertain or failure carries potential consequence. The Game Master is otherwise responsible for deciding the results of your actions.

If at any point during the game you are required to perform math that results in a decimal, that number is always rounded down unless otherwise specified.

# Primary Stats

Each character has four Primary Stats that are used to derive other stats and abilities. These stats are: *strength*, *dexterity*, *intelligence*, and *resolve*. All primary stats are represented by roll values ranging from r8 to r20.

##### Table: Primary Stat Steps
| Roll Value | Step Name |
|:-:|:-|
| r8 | Below Average |
| r10 | Average |
| r12 | Above Average |
| r14 | Great |
| r16 | Superb |
| r18 | Powerful |
| r20 | Epic |

Characters typically start with stats ranging from below average (r8) to above average (r10).

### Strength (STR)

Strength measures physical power, and general vitality. This stat is important for atheletes, labourers, and those who engage in physical contests.

### Dexterity (DEX)

Dexterity measures the reaction speed, balance, and precision of your character. It is an important stat for characters who want to be stealthy, perform sleight of hand, tinker with devices, or make attacks.

### Intelligence (INT)

Intelligence determines how well your character learns and reasons, is for those who want to understand how complex things work, speak many languages, or recall important information. In genres that have magic it also determines a character's capacity for magical energies.

### Resolve (RES)

Resolve is the determination, intuition, and spirituality of your character. It is primarily used for characters who want to persevere through pure force of will, practice the arts or business, or communicate effectively with others.

# Secondary Stats

Characters have several secondary stats: *health*, *endurance*, *stamina*, *focus*, *initiative*, *armour rating*, *damage reduction*, *deflection*, *evasion*, *fortitude*, *willpower*, *speed*, and *size*. These stats are typically calculated based on on your primary stats. Armour rating and damage reduction are determined by what your character is wearing, while *speed* and *size* are determined by your character's ancestry. The first four of the secondary stats (health, endurance, stamina, and focus) are also considered *resources*. Resources have current and maximum values, and they may be spent or damaged.

##### Table: Secondary Stats
| Secondary Stat | Formula |
|:-|:-:|
| Health (HP) | Max STR |
| Endurance (ED) | Max RES |
| Stamina (ST) | Max DEX |
| Focus (FP) | Max INT |
| Initiative (INIT) | DEX + RES |
| Deflection (DEF) | RES + AR |
| Evasion (EVA) | DEX + AR |
| Fortitude (FORT) | STR + RES |
| Willpower (WILL) | INT + RES |

For example: if you have a strength of r12, then you have a maximum strength of 12 and therefore 12 health.

### Health (HP)

Health, or hit points, are an abstraction representing how healthy a character is at the current moment. Any damage taken to your health represents a serious injury.

### Endurance (ED)

Endurance represents your ability to shrug off potential injuries before suffering serious damage, and is easy to restore with a little rest.

### Stamina (ST)

Stamina is used to perform tricks, maneuvers, and certain physical actions.

### Focus (FP)

Focus is used to cast spells and perform special abilities.

### Initiative (INIT)

Initiative is your ability to react first in a moment of conflict, and in other rare circumstances.

### Armour Rating (AR)

Armour rating represents the effectiveness of defensive equipment to neutralize incoming attacks. This stat is directly applied to your deflection and evasion.

### Damage Reduction (DR)

Damage reduction represents the effectiveness of defensive equipment to reduce the force of incoming successful hits. Any damage you take is reduced by your total damage reduction.

### Deflection (DEF)

Deflection is the capacity to shrug off incoming attacks and abilities before they can even take effect. The use of deflection is often done automatically if no other type of defense is appropriate.

### Evasion (EVA)

Evasion is your ability to quickly avoid danger, rather than relying on deflection to take hits. The use of evasion is often done intentionally rather than automatically relying on other forms of defense.

### Fortitude (FORT)

Fortitude is your ability to resist poison and disease, and many forms of elemental damage. In dire circumstances it is also used to avoid potential death.

### Willpower (WILL)

Willpower is your ability to resist temptation or supernatural influence, both mental and physical. This is not the same as preventing effects that harm the body, but instead those that control the body or mind. Similarly it allows you to judge whether or not someone seems believable. When casting spells it determines the strength of that spell's effect.

### Speed (SPD)

Your speed is a measurement of your average walking distance over six seconds. You can run three times this distance in the same amount of time. This stat also effects other forms of travel, like climbing, swimming, and flying if able. Usually these are performed at half your speed without if you do not have special abilities that state otherwise.

### Size (SZ)

Size is measured in size categories. Most characters will normally be considered medium-sized, however, certain genres and settings may provide you with additional options for playing in different size categories. Your size may provide you with modifiers to some of your other stats.

##### Table: Size & Size Modifiers
| Size | Avg. Height | Avg. Weight | Strength | Dexterity | Speed |
|:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Tiny | ½m~¾m | 5kg~15kg | -3 | +2 | -1 |
| Very Small | ¾m~1m | 15kg~30kg | -2 | +1 | -1 |
| Small | 1m~1½m | 30kg~60kg | -1 | +1 | - |
| Medium | 1½m~2m | 40kg~90kg | - | - | - |
| Large | 2m~2½m | 60kg~150kg | +1 | -1 | - |
| Very Large | 2½m~3m | 90kg~250kg | +2 | -1 | +1 |
| Huge | 3m~4m | 150kg~500kg | +3 | -2 | +1 |

# Skills

Like primary stats, skill values are represented by roll values. All skills have associated primary stats that are rolled with that skill whenever it is performed (listed next to that skill's name). Rolling dice to determine the outcome of a skill is called a skill check.

##### Table: Skill Steps
| Roll Value | Step Name |
|:-:|:-|
| - | Untrained |
| r4 | Trained |
| r6 | Adept |
| r8 | Practiced |
| r10 | Proficient |
| r12 | Exceptional |
| r14 | Disciplined |
| r16 | Accomplished |
| r18 | Expert |
| r20 | Master |

## Basic Skills

All characters can perform all basic skills, even if they are not trained in them. There are five basic skills: *agility*, *athletics*, *charisma*, *knowledge*, and *perception*.

### Agility (DEX)

Light and fast movement are the work of agility. This skill allows you to perform dives, flips, walk silently, hide in dark areas, and squeeze into tight spaces.

### Athletics (STR)

You use the strength of your body to manipulate the world around you and move within it. Athletics includes lifting, climbing, swimming, and jumping, among other physical activities.

### Charisma (RES)

The capacity to convince others to follow your lead, whether that means through intimidation, deception, or appealing to emotion. The use of charisma is not limited to coercing others to follow your lead, it also includes the effort to get others to appeal to your genuine interest.

### Knowledge (INT)

Knowledge represents your ability to recall information. It can be anything from the widely available to the potentially unknown, such as historical events, people, or organizations to secret societies, or the occult. Primarly this skill is used to recall information linked to your character's background and other skills. Recalling information outside your character's expertise is much more difficult. This skill can also be used to make effective work studying new topics, with difficulty depending on your level of familiarity.

### Perception (DEX)

Perception is used to track animals, monsters, or people, to detect stealthy individuals, or find hidden secrets and traps. This skill covers the use of all major senses. Even if one sense is limited, it may still be possible to use your other senses to make up for it. 

## Complex Skills

Unlike basic skills, a character must be at least trained in an complex skill to use it unless their ancestry or background provides a bonus to that skill. Some additional genres provide their own complex skills, but regardless of genre there are five core complex skills: *contacts*, *craft*, *medicine*, *sleight*, and *wild empathy*. All additional types of skills, such as combat skills, spellcasting skills, and even languages are also considered complex skills.

### Contacts (RES)

Sometimes you just know someone who can get what you need done, and if you don't, maybe you know how to find one. In a city or town there's always that somebody. This skill can be used to find people in urban areas where tracking them with perception can't get the job done. It is likely that this task may involve bribes or threats. This skill may even used to determine if you already have an existing rapport with newly introduced non-player characters.

### Craft (INT)

Adventurers may often find themselves in unexpected situations. Crafting can allow for the improvisational construction of traps and tools, for tying strong knots, and even the repair of damaged items. While not necessarily a craft itself, it can even be used to appraise the quality of goods and equipment, or learn how to use unrecognizable equipment.

This skill can also be used to make higher quality custom equipment. When doing so, it will require that you have a toolkit dedicated to the type of craft work you want to pursue (or a workshop containing those tools), and most importantly, a background, archetype, or other form of skillset that relates to the type of items you are crafting. If you do not possess some measure of these things, you can always work together with other characters.

### Medicine (INT)

This skill is important for anyone seeking to apply medicines and treat wounds, injuries, or illnesses. It can also be used to recognize materials, chemicals, and plants with medicinal properties, and recall information on medicines and herbs.

### Sleight (DEX)

Whether its traps, locks, pockets, or just fancy tricks, all such things are within your grasp. While this skill is generally used for everything a thief would do, it can also be used to conceal objects and perform tricks. This skill is also used to construct disguises for to hiding in plain sight.

### Wild Empathy (RES)

In the wild, many animals are unfriendly or fearful towards the majority of people. This skill allows you to speak to and calm down such animals. It can also be used to convince certain animals, like guard dogs, that you are friendly much in the same way you could use charisma to persuade someone.

While this skill does not provide the ability to understand animals directly, it does provide the ability to share in confidence and trust, and to form an emotional bond with animals. Some animals that spend lots of time around people, like cats and dogs, are also capable of responding to very simple spoken requests once this trust is assured. The types of animals who don't, might respond to simple gestures that can signal basic requests.

## Languages

When characters are created they are considered native speakers of their starting languages. If any characters wish to learn new languages they will need to acquire them exactly the same way that one would acquire a new complex skill. Therefore, non-native languages have values as roll values. Languages as skills are associated with intelligence.

Whenever your character tries to read, write, speak, or listen to a language that they aren't native in, they will usually need to make a Language check. Once you become a master of that language, it is functionally the same as if you were native in that Language, so you will no longer need to roll to determine success.

The availability of languages to your character are determined by the setting that you are in. Usually there is a "common" language that all characters speak, with individual languages for some subgroups. In the fantasy genre it is common for most monstrous creatures to also share an "outsider" language between them.

## Combat Skills

There are four core combat skills: *finesse*, *martial*, *ranged*, and *unarmed*. Although combat skills are complex skills, they are not required to make attacks. Attacks can be made with any weapon, even untrained, by rolling your dexterity to hit with those weapons. Making attacks with higher accuracy requires training, and each combat skill improves different categories of weapons. Some weapons can be used by multiple skills, which are called cross-skill weapons.

### Finesse (DEX)

Combat with small or precise weapons. This skill is dedicated to utilizing fast attacks to constantly threaten opponents and find openings and weak spots.

### Martial (DEX)

Combat with heavy or broad weapons. Although it is not as likely to get as many good strikes on an opponent as someone trained in Finesse, it is more likely to deliever stronger blows even without striking the weak points as martial weapons are generally heavier.

### Ranged (DEX)

Ranged combat includes the use of all weapons that involve projectiles, such as bows, guns, and throwing weapons.

### Unarmed (DEX)

Unarmed combat involves anything from complex martial arts to boxing. Unarmed combat is the least likely to deal lethal blows, but is important for anyone who might find themselves often fighting without a weapon.

## Other Skills

There may be additional skills available depending on the genre you are playing.

## Skill Checks

If you have taken an action and success is not guaranteed, you will need to make a *skill check*. To do so you will roll your skill and associated primary stat together and compare the result to a *difficulty value* determined secretly by the Game Master. The result of any skill check is determined by its relationship to the difficulty value. This can result in varying degrees of success or failure.

For example: you attempt to leap over a large pit. This requires an athletics check, which is associated with your strength stat. If you have a strength of r12, and an athletics of r4, you will roll r16. If you were not trained in athletics you would still at least roll your strength.

Given a roll against any difficulty value, there are multiple possible outcomes: *failure*, *graze*, *success*, or *critical success*. When you match or exceed the difficulty, you succeed. Other outcomes depend on how far away you are from the difficulty value. Rolling at least 7 above the difficulty value is a critical success. Rolling below the difficulty is a graze, unless you roll at least 7 below the difficulty, which is a fail. The exact nature of a graze is determined by context and the Game Master: sometimes it is a success with a cost, or a failure with a positive benefit.

Some circumstances may require a contest between two sources, such as an attacker against a defender. These are called *opposed checks* as both sides are comparing their skills. In cases where one is simply creating a difficulty value for the other, all things function as normal.

For example: A character attacks another and the defender rolls deflection to defend against damage. If the attacker succeeds, they do full damage, but on a graze they do half damage.

For other types of opposed checks where only one side can win (such as an arm wrestling contest), any comparisons that result in a tie or lower are all considered failures. Grazes are not possible in this type of opposed check.

### Challenge Difficulty

Various challenges will come at various difficulties. These difficulties are represented by a name and a value. Most challenges requiring you to roll dice will exist within the *easy* to *ambitious* difficulty range (although more difficult challenges may present themselves) as described by the following table:

##### Table: Challenge Difficulties
| Difficulty<br/>Value | Difficulty Name |
|:-:|:-|
| 5 | Everyday |
| 7 | Easy |
| 10 | Moderate |
| 14 | Hard |
| 19 | Challenging |
| 25 | Ambitious |
| 32 | Absurd |
| 40 | Improbable |

For a visualization on what rolls represent different outcomes in relation to various difficulty values:

##### Table: Roll vs Difficulty as Outcomes
| Roll | 7<br/>(Easy) | 10<br/>(Moderate) | 14<br/>(Hard) | 19<br/>(Challenging) | 25<br/>(Ambitious) |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 2 | Graze | Fail | Fail | Fail | Fail |
| 5 | Graze | Graze | Fail | Fail | Fail |
| 7 | Success | Graze | Fail | Fail | Fail |
| 10 | Success | Success | Graze | Fail | Fail |
| 12 | Success | Success | Graze | Fail | Fail |
| 15 | Critical | Success | Success | Graze | Fail |
| 17 | Critical | Critical | Success | Graze | Fail |
| 20 | Critical | Critical | Success | Success | Graze |
| 22 | Critical | Critical | Critical | Success | Graze |
| 25 | Critical | Critical | Critical | Success | Success |

A more full table is available in the [appendix](/Basic/Appendix.md#table-roll-vs-difficulty-as-outcomes-expanded).

### Skill Duration

While most basic skills and actions can be performed in a matter of a couple seconds, some complex skills and actions cannot be performed so quickly. While it is expected that most complex actions that a character can take (as a result of skill checks) may take at least a few minutes, the exact duration is up to the Game Master based on the circumstances of the skill check. Some actions may even take several hours.

### Advantage & Disadvantage

Occasionally, circumstance, clever roleplaying, or one of your abilities will provide you with advantage. For each source of advantage you have to a roll, you may reroll a die of your choice and keep the better result.

Disadvantage works similarly to advantage, but instead of keeping the better result you must keep the worst result. The die that you reroll when you have disadvantage is the die with the greatest result.

Paired instances of advantage and disadvantage cancel each other out. If you have multiple sources granting advantage, it would require just as many sources of disadvantage to entirely cancel out.

### Group Actions

Sometimes multiple players will want to perform the same type of action. In this case, they will all roll the same skill check for that action, but only the best (or worst) result will be used.

### Talents & Special Abilities

Under normal circumstances you will dictate what you do rather than specifying the exact game action you take. In the case of talents or other special abilities, however, these aspects of your character are more under you control. In this circumstance it is more appropriate to declare exactly what you are using, and then describe what your character does as it performs that action.

For example: You might say, *"I jump across the pit,"* and you would need to roll an athletics check to succeed. Alternatively, you could instead say, *"I cast Feather Fall then jump across the pit,"* and it might make it easy enough that you don't need to roll at all.

# Encounters

Encounters are time-sensitive scenarios where each action you take matters. Encounters typically begin in a few different ways:

* If two or more characters or creatures intend to perform actions that oppose each other (combat and non-combat).
* When a character is aware of a potential danger, and intends to be deliberate and calculating with their actions.
* When there is limited time to overcome a complex challenge.

Encounters from start to end follow this sequence:

1. All characters roll initiative.
2. If it is combat, determine which characters are aware of their opponents. If these characters are aware of their opponents, but not the other way around, they can act during a surprise round.
3. Characters who are not surprised take turns in initiative order for their team during the surprise round.
4. After the surprise round (if any), all characters take turns in initiative order for their team during regular rounds. This repeats until the encounter ends.

### Initiative

When it comes time to begin an encounter each player will roll their initiative stat, which is their dexterity plus their resolve. The results rolled from highest to lowest determine turn order. If there are any ties, players can decide amongst each other who goes first.

If there are multiple teams in conflict (such as during a combat encounter), each team present will take turns, one character at a time. The team with the individial with the highest initiative will go first. For each team, the characters with the highest initiative will go first. Teams will take turns in this way until all of their characters have acted, then will do so again during the next round.

For example: Four players attempt to sneak up on two guards. They fail to be stealthy and alert the guards who begin to attack the players. All six characters will roll for initiative. One of the players rolled the highest initiative so their team will go first. Player #1 will act, then Guard #1, Player #2, Guard #2, Player #3, and finally Player #4. The team containing the players had more characters to act, but each team's members still get to act.

### Rounds

Each round represents about six seconds in the game world, meaning there are 10 rounds in a minute. During each round characters will take turns as previously determined by their initiative rolls. Each character will perform up to their entire turn's worth of actions.

When the rules refer to a *full-round* or a number of rounds, this means from the start of the turn in which that duration began to the start of that turn in a future round. This means that a full-round effect ends before that character starts their next turn, but is still occuring before that turn.

### Complex Challenges

Some encounters are considered complex challenges: there is a limited amount of time to complete them, or a series of skill checks are required to overcome them. In these encounters the exact duration of a player's turn is abstract and non-specific. Since players will usually be performing skill checks, the average duration of a turn is the average time it takes to perform all of the player's skill checks and minor actions (assuming they all take about the same amount of time).

Most basic combat scenarios can be considered complex challenges rather than tactical combat encounters. In these situations it is more common for simple enemies to go down in a single hit, while elite enemies will require more significant damage before becoming defeated.

## Actions

During an encounter with more concrete turn length (such as a tactical combat), any action that you take uses a specific portion of your turn. The amount of your turn each action requires is based on their action speed. These speeds—in order from slowest to fastest—are: *extended*, *full-round*, *standard*, *swift*, and *free*.

Since a turn is six seconds long, we can also measure each action in seconds. Full-round, standard, and swift actions are each six, four, and two seconds long respectively. Free actions don't take up any time the first time you use one, but each additional free action on your turn is considered a swift action.

Extended actions take time that is longer than a single turn. Extended actions are only performed when their complete duration has been met. Once started they may be cancelled at any point in their duration, so long as it is your turn.

Additionally there are also *reactions* and *free reactions*. Reactions are special actions that do not take up a portion of your turn, but instead happen during another character's turn. You may only take a single reaction each round, and only if you meet the conditions to use that reaction. There is no limit on the number of free reactions that can be taken each round.

In addition to the following basic actions, characters may perform other special actions provided by skills and talents, such as maneuvers or spells.

#### Attack

**Action Speed:** Swift

Make an attack on a target with one of your wielded weapons or with your bare hands.

When making an attack, first roll your appropriate combat skill against your target's deflection. A result of a graze or better is considered a hit.

On a hit, you then roll your weapon's damage. Both grazing hits and successful hits are reduced by the target's damage reduction. Damage from grazing hits are then further reduced by half. The minimum amount of damage that is dealt by a hit is 1 damage. Critical hits both ignore damage reduction and deal bonus damage as specified by the weapon used.

Additional attacks made during the same turn get a -4 penalty to hit for each attack you made before it in the same turn. This penalty applies to all forms of attack actions except reactions (such as by a readied action). This is known as the *multiple attack penalty*.

Attacks made against enemies who cannot see you, or who are surrounded on two opposite sides, are made with advantage. These are known as *sneak attacks* and *flanking attacks* respectively. You do not need to be contributing to a flank to make a flanking attack. If you make an attack that is both a sneak attack and a flanking attack it will provide you double advantage on that attack roll.

#### Block

**Stamina Cost:** 1  
**Action Speed:** Free Reaction

If you would be hit, you may use your shield to block an incoming attack in front of you. If you do, that damage is dealt to your shield's durability instead of you, and is reduced by the block value of that shield. Critical hits get half of their bonus damage against blocked hits.

If the shield would be dealt damage in excess of the shield's durability, the remaining damage is dealt directly to you as a successful hit reduced by your armour's damage reduction (to a minimum of 1).

Shields with no durability are considered broken and cannot be used to block until they are repaired.

#### Brandish

**Action Speed:** Free

Choose which of your items you are wielding in your hands. This can be items from your inventory, or items found in your immediate area.

#### Delay

**Action Speed:** None

Before your turn begins, you may choose to delay your turn by moving the start of your turn to a later point in the turn order. This action can only be taken when your turn would begin, and only once each round. This action may even be taken while unconscious or dying. 

#### Drop Prone

**Action Speed:** Free

You become prone. Ranged attacks against prone characters are made with disadvantage, but melee attacks are made with advantage. While prone your movement speed is halved.

#### Evade

**Stamina Cost:** 1  
**Action Speed:** Free Reaction or Reaction

Roll your evasion to defend against an attack instead of using your deflection. If the incoming attack grazes against your evasion roll, it is considered a failure instead. After you evade, you may drop prone. You may evade as a reaction instead of a free reaction to move up to 1m instead of dropping prone.

#### Interact

**Action Speed:** Variable

This action covers most basic actions, like opening doors, activating wielded items, or using objects in the immediate area. Unless an object specifies, or a task requires an extended amount of time to perform, this action is considered a swift action.

#### Move

**Stamina Cost:** 0 or 1  
**Action Speed:** Swift or Free

Move a distance up to your speed. If you move more than 1m, this is considered a swift action, otherwise, it is considered a free action. Additionally, this action costs 1 stamina if it is not the first time you have used it during your turn.

If the terrain you are moving over is rough or difficult to navigate, then you can only move half as far over that terrain. If your speed is 1m or less, you can still move at least 1m over difficult terrain per move action.

If your speed is reduced to 1m or less, you cannot move 1m as a free action. This includes moving 1m over difficut terrain, if your speed is reduced to 2m or less.

#### Parry

**Stamina Cost:** 1  
**Action Speed:** Free Reaction

Use a wielded item with the parry feature to defend against an attack, adding its parry value to your deflection. If the incoming attack grazes against your deflection roll, it is considered a failure instead.

#### Ready

**Action Speed:** Standard

Declare any standard, swift, or free action to use as a reaction given a specified trigger of your choice.

For example: while standing at the end of a hallway, you can ready an attack action against any targets that come into view (such as from a room attached to that hallway). Readied actions are performed immediately, even if that means they might happen in the middle of, or before, another action.

#### Rise From Prone

**Action Speed:** Swift

You cancel the effects of prone. Ranged and melee attacks against you are made as normal, and your movement speed is restored.

#### Seek Cover

**Action Speed:** Swift

If you are next to a barricade, or the edge of a wall, or some similar structure, you can seek cover behind that object. While being provided cover, you are considered to be partially concealed from ranged enemies until your next turn, giving disadvantage to ranged actions made against your deflection and evasion.

You may also use this action as a free action if you have moved more than once during your turn. If you do, you do not need to hide behind an obstacle to get the benefits; it is as though you are using your speed and movement to avoid being targeted from a distance.

#### Use Skill

**Action Speed:** Variable

Skills can be performed as normal during any type of encounter. The exact duration that a skill takes to perform is the same as it would be during any complex challenge. Some skills may take more than a few minutes to complete. This means that most characters who attempt to use complex skills during an encounter may find themselves unable to perform other actions until the action is completed (unless they leave their attempt as incomplete).

# Damage

When a character is hit by an attack, trap, or by any means, they will take damage. Before any damage is dealt, it is reduced by their damage reduction. No matter how much damage reduction a character has, the minimum amount of damage they must take is 1.

Any damage dealt to a character is taken first to their endurance, and then the difference to their health if no endurance remains. When a character is dealt damage, if they would then have zero endurance and are reduced to less than zero health (health can be negative), that character is given the dying condition. If they are reduced to exactly zero health, they are only given the unconscious condition.

Attacks made by weapons with the nonlethal feature cause a creature to be given the unconscious condition instead of the dying condition when applicable. If nonlethal attacks bring a character to negative health equal to their maximum health, then they are given the dying condition.

Damaging items or objects is done by making the relevant skill checks against a difficulty value based on the perceived difficulty to break that item or object (as determined by the Game Master).

For example: breaking a door with an axe would be an Athletics or Martial check against an arbitrary difficulty value (if the door was made of wood, it would likely be easy).

Damage that is halved or doubled multiple times are modified at an altered rate. If damage would be halved twice, it is instead reduced into a third. If it would be halved again, it is reduced to a quarter, and so on. Similarly, if damage is doubled twice, it is instead increased to a triple. If it would be douled again, it is increased to a quadruple, and so on.

## Damage Types

There are three main categories of damage types: *physical*, *elemental*, and *typeless*.

The majority of damage is dealt as physical damage, which has three types: *bludgeoning*, *piercing*, and *slashing*. Most sources of damage will deal one of these three types of damage. 

Most other damage is dealt as elemental damage. By default, all elemental damage bypasses damage reduction unless otherwise specified, or it is blocked. The types of elemental damage are: *arcane*, *cold*, *electric*, *fire*, *radiant*, and *void*.

Any time a damage type is not listed as one of the physical or elemental damage types it can be considered typeless damage. Since typeless damage effectively has no type, it will always bypass all damage reduction. Typeless damage is very rare.

# Effects

The duration of any given effect is determined by the source of that effect. Usually this means that most effects are temporary. Unless otherwise specified by the source of the effect, or the effect itself, the effect is permanent.

Temporary effects that alter your primary stats, do not also alter your resource stats. They only change derived stats that rely on rolling that primary stat. Permanent effects that alter your primary stats, however, do alter your resource stats.

For example: A character with a strength of r12 is given an effect with alters their size, increasing their strength by +2. This results in a strength of r12+2, which changes their athletics, fortitude, and damage rolls, but it does not change their maximum health from 12 to 14.

Multiple effects of the same type do not stack unless otherwise specified.

#### Blind

Blinded characters suffer a disadvantage to all rolls that require that character to attack, interact with, brandish, or use special abilities at, a specified target. This does not count for interacting with or brandishing their own personal items. In addition to this, all terrain is difficult to move across.

#### Burning

Burning objects are dangerous and likely to cause nearby objects to continue to burn if not contained or extinguished. Burning characters suffer damage over time.

When applied to a character, burning is an effect that has multiple degrees, as specified by a number. If a burning character has burning applied to them, add the burning values together. At the beginning of a burning character's turn, they take fire damage equal to r4 plus r2 for every degree of burning beyond the first, then the burning effect decreases by 1, until it goes away entirely. Burning 1 would be r4 damage, while burning 3 would be r8 damage. Damage from burning bypasses all damage reduction. Dousing a target in water will completely remove the burning.

#### Debilitation

A debilitation is an effect that applies to one of your stats. Debilitated stats are rolled with disadvantage. Multiple debilitations to the same stat do not stack.

#### Dying

When a character is given the dying effect they are also become unconscious. At the start of each turn that a character is dying, they must make a fortitude check versus a difficulty equal to their negative health. If that character succeeds three times, they lose the dying condition, but remain unconscious. If they fail three times, they die. Criticals count as two successes, and grazes count as neither a success or failure. Successes and failures do not need to be consecutive. Stabilized characters remain at negative health. At the end of every round that a character is dying they lose one more health.

#### Encumbered

Encumbered characters are carrying too much. They get a disadvantage to both strength and dexterity, and have halved speed.

#### Enhancement

An enhancement is an effect that applies to one of your stats. Enhanced stats are rolled with advantage. Multiple enhancements to the same stat do not stack.

#### Overencumbered

Overencumbered characters suffer the same effects as encumbered characters, but instead of moving at half speed, they cannot move at all.

#### Prone

Prone characters are either kneeling or laying down on the ground. Ranged attacks against prone characters are made with disadvantage, but melee attacks are made with advantage. You must spend a swift action to stand up from being prone.

#### Sickness

Sickness is an effect that has multiple degrees, as specified by a number. This number is a penalty that you take to *all* of your rolls. Additionally, every day that passes while you are sick you lose health (after recovering health from resting, if applicable) equal to half this sickness value (rounded up). Stamina, focus, and endurance recovered during rests are also reduced by half this value (rounded up) to a minimum of one.

For example: If you have a sickness of 3 and you take a long rest, you will recover 1 health, then lose 2. You will also recover 2 less stamina, focus, and endurance during that rest.

Multiple sickness effects do not add their degree of effect together, instead only apply a penalty based on the strongest sickness effect. Multiple sources of sickness are still tracked separately.

If a sickness effect does not specify a duration, that duration is assumed to be 1 week. After reaching this duration the sickened character will roll a fortitude check to resist the sickness. If successful, the degree of effect is reduced by 1. If no difficulty is specified, it is assumed to be 10 (moderate).

#### Stunned

At the beginning of a stunned character's turn, they lose the stunned effect and a swift action. Until then, stunned characters cannot perform reactions.

A character can become stunned multiple times, causing them to lose more swift actions at the beginning of their turn. Regardless of how many times a character is stunned, they will entirely lose the stun effect when their turn begins.

For example: A character manages to become stunned four times before their next turn. At the beginning of their turn they will lose three swift actions (their whole turn), and no longer be stunned. They may still perform a free action.

If a character is in the middle of an extended action or readying an action and they become stunned, then that action becomes interrupted and is not performed.

#### Unconscious

Unconscious characters can perform no actions. Loud noises or other disrupting behaviour may awaken an unconscious individual. When a character becomes unconscious they also become prone.

# Concentration

Some abilities or effects may require you to maintain *concentration*. Concentration can only be used to maintain a single ability or effect at a time. If at any point you are required to maintain concentration on multiple effects at once, you must choose one to maintain and the rest to lose. In a way concentration acts like a limited resource, but you never lose the ability to concentrate by spending it.

Concentration requires an active and conscious mind. If at any point you become unconscious, you automatically lose your concentration. If you become stunned, you may make a willpower check against the source that provided the stun. If the source does not have a difficulty value, then make the check against a difficult of 10 instead. If successful, the concentration is maintained.

# Maneuvers

Maneuvers are special abilities acquired by advancing combat skills. Each combat skill has access to different maneuvers.

### Acquiring Maneuvers

Whenever you become trained in a new combat skill, you acquire a maneuver from that specialization. These specializations match the combat skills. You gain additional maneuvers for every two rank advancements beyond the first rank in the same skill. Maneuvers cost stamina and can only be used once each round. Any characters that start with combat skills also start with maneuvers based on their advancement in that skill. Maneuvers gained from advancing one combat skill can be used by your other combat skills, so long as they could also be learned by that skill.

For example: You advanced your Unarmed skill and learned Heavy Strike. Since you are also trained in Martial, you can also use Heavy Strike with the Martial skill.

Click [here](/Basic/Maneuvers.md) for the list of universal maneuvers.  
Click [here](/Fantasy/Maneuvers.md) for the list of fantasy maneuvers.

Maneuvers also have a listed type, which can be one of: *offensive*, *defensive*, or *tactical*. Typically offensive maneuvers perform attacks, defensive maneuvers can be used to defend yourself or others, and tactical maneuvers provide other forms of actions.

### Performing Maneuvers

When you perform a maneuver on a target it may have a chance for the target to resist the effects of that maneuver. They will roll the skill or stat listed to make an opposed check against your attack roll. If the attacker grazes against the resist, the effects are applied at half duration (if any, rounded down). Otherwise it is simply considered a failure instead, and the defender suffers no effects. Any attacks are still made on the target even if they resist the effects of the maneuver.

For example: You perform a Crippling Strike against a target. First you make an attack, then if the attack hits or grazes, the target rolls to resist. If your maneuver's roll to hit is a 12 and the defender's resist is a 14, the maneuver grazed against their resist. Crippling Strike's effects only lasts 1 round instead of 2.

### Improvising Maneuvers

Although maneuvers must normally be learned in order to use, you can also improvise maneuvers. If you do improvise a maneuver, you make all skill checks and attack rolls specified in that maneuver with a -2 penalty (not including damage rolls), and the stamina cost is increased by 1. If that maneuver is a standard, swift, or free action, it becomes one action speed slower.

For example: You do not have the Feint maneuver, but intend to improvise it. You will get a -2 penalty on your charisma check to perform the maneuver, it will cost 3 stamina instead of 2, and becomes a standard action instead of a swift action.

# Resting

At some point during an adventure you may find yourself low on your resources (health, endurance, stamina, and focus). In order to restore these resources, you need to rest. There are two different types of rest: the short rest and the long rest. Depending on the type of rest performed, you will recover a different amount of spent resources.

##### Table: Rest Recovery Rates
| Resource | Short Rest | Long Rest |
|:-|:-:|:-:|
| Health | None | 1 |
| Endurance | Min FORT | Max FORT ×½ |
| Stamina | Min INIT | Max INIT ×½ |
| Focus | Min WILL | Max WILL ×½ |

You can calculate the minimum of a stat by counting the number of dice you would roll and then adding any bonuses.

For example: If you have a Fortitude of r22+1, that would be a ten-sided-die and a twelve-sided-die. Two dice plus the modifier of 1 results in a minimum roll that is 3. 

If the amount of a resource recovered during a rest would be greater than the maximum amount you can have of that resource type, it would recover that amount instead.

For example: If you have a maximum Stamina of 10, but half your maximum Initiative is 12, then you will only ever recover up to 10 Stamina during a long rest.

### Short Rest

A short rest is basically a break from strenuous activity. Whenever you take a break to relax, meditate, or make preparations over a period of thirty minutes to an hour, that may be considered a short rest.

An extended period up to about two hours containing a single simple activity, such as performing research or crafting an item with a very low difficulty (of 5 or less) can also be considered a short rest.

### Long Rest

A long rest requires about eight hours of sleep. If a long rest is interrupted part way, then it is considered incomplete and only half of the normal resources are restored. The long rest may be resumed to restore the remaining resources.

Characters with substantial wounds will require substantial rest to recover. Other characters may treat the wounds of another character performing a long rest by using the medicine skill against a difficulty of 10 (Moderate) or 14 (Hard) if they have negative health. If successful, the amount of health that character recovers during that long rest is increased by 1 to 2.

Abilties that can be used a number of times per rest are restored after a complete long rest.

For the purpose of recovering resources, any short rests not taken during the day are considered taken during a long rest.

For example: If you took a single short rest (of the two permitted), then took a long rest at the end of the day, you would recover your resources during that long rest as if it was combined with an additional short rest. If you didn't take any short rests during the day, then it would be as if all of your rests were combined.

### Rest Limitations

Characters can only physically rest so often and are limited to a number of rests per day. A long rest is effectively sleep and each character must take one long rest each day. Tracking exhaustion for sleepless nights is an [optional rule](/Advanced/AdvancedAilments.md#fatigue). Short rests are optional, and a character may take up to two short rests each day.

# Creating a Character

The process of creating a character is a series of small steps. A character is made up of a few aspects: *ancestry*, *background*, *archetype*, and *trait*. As a reminder, whenever you assign any stat or skill a roll value, it does not mean to roll those dice and assign it the resulting value. It means that you assign it the roll value itself. This represents what you roll when you use that stat or skill.

### Ancestry

It is not guaranteed that a genre or setting has a multitude of racial options, but Humans are usually an available option. The ancestry you pick will provide bonuses to your primary stats, a racial ability, and determine your size and movement speed.

Click [here](/Fantasy/Ancestries.md) for a list of fantasy ancestries.

### Background

Backgrounds are the profession or history of your character before they left that life behind them to become an adventurer or hero (or whatever the genre you are playing calls them). The background you choose will provide bonuses to some of your skills.

Click [here](/Fantasy/Backgrounds.md) for a list of fantasy backgrounds.

### Archetype

Archetypes get you on the path to building a character with a strong theme, but they do not limit any of your character advancement options. Essentially they are a title that provides you with some benefits, much like backgrounds. They determine what skills and abilities you start with.

Click [here](/Fantasy/Archetypes.md) for a list of fantasy archetypes.

### Trait

Traits are unique abilities that only you possess. This part of character creation is entirely up to you (and your Game Master). Generally traits are special things you can do or have. They provide opportunities to roleplay in a unique way, or help make your character stand out from others with a similar background or archetype. They can be mundane or magical in nature, and are something you can describe in a couple sentences. Traits should provide some degree of actual mechanical benefit, but the exact benefit is to be determined by the context of your adventure and what your Game Master determines is fair.

The trait you decide upon can be something very similar to an existing talent or spell, but the obvious drawback is that you don't get some other type of unique ability.

Click [here](/Basic/Traits.md) for a list of example traits.

### Starting Stats

After choosing your ancestry, background, archetype, and trait, you will need to decide what your starting primary stats are. Assign one of them to be *above average* (r12), one of them to be *below average* (r8), and the rest as *average* (r10).

### Motivation

One of the most important defining features of a character is their motivation. It can be described in a few sentences or less. Ultimately it will be a source of both conflict and cooperation, as characters will need to make decisions that fulfill their motivations. Characters that fulfill their motivations during a game session provide an experience bonus to all characters at the end of a game session.

Example: To protect the weak from those who abuse their power.

Some motivations may represent more circumstantial character developmental ordeals. These types of motivations when completed are usually then replaced with another motivation, assuming that it doesn't end that character's heroic journey. Because these types of motivations are more difficult to complete, making progress towards completing that motivation is considered enough to provide the experience bonus.

Example: To find a lost family member; or to avenge a death.

## Equipment

Characters start with some degree of currency or equipment. Most items that a character can acquire and use are normal worldly items. The only restriction is if it meets the setting you are playing in. For example: machine guns or flashlights are not a likely device to have in a medieval setting, but a torch or a sword is.

Although you can generally have any item imaginable, some items have predetermined statistics like weapons and armour.

Click [here](/Basic/Equipment.md) to see the specific rules for various types of equipment.  
Click [here](/Medieval/Equipment.md) to see the rules and tables for medieval equipment.  
Click [here](/Fantasy/MagicEquipment.md) to see the rules and tables for fantasy magic equipment.

### Currency

There are various types of currencies that represent the money your character needs to spend on items and goods. The exact specifications of which may depend on the setting and genre, including a specified baseline currency which are all fundamentally equivalent. This means that for the purposes of converting gameplay material between settings and genres you can convert these currencies equivalently. If in one setting the cost of an item is measured in dollars ($), and in another the cost is measured in silver pieces (sp), then those values are converted directly from dollars into silver pieces. Some settings and genres may have additional currencies that are measured relative to the baseline currency.

All characters start with 50 units of starting money which they can spend on starting equipment.

### Weapons

Weapons are the means to inflict attacks upon opponents using combat skills. Weapons exist in multiple categories named after the combat skill required to use them. There is also a category of basic weapons, which can be used by anyone trained in any of the combat skills. Weapons will have both a listed damage roll value, and a damage type. Some creatures and armours may be weaker to certain damage types. Although unarmed attacks are not actually made with weapons, they are listed under the unarmed weapon category.

Click [here](/Basic/Equipment.md#weapons) for the rules for weapons and weapon features.  
Click [here](/Medieval/Equipment.md#weapons) for the rules and tables for medieval weapons.

### Armour

Although a character can wear any amount of gear, such as clothes, gloves, boots, headgear, cloaks, accessories, and so on, only some of these items are considered *armour*. Armour exists in a few specific *armour slots* when worn: *body*, *head*, *arms*, *hands*, *shield*, *legs*, and *feet*. Armour items will have some minor features, but usually they also have an armour rating and a damage reduction. The values from all of your slots are added together to provide a total armour rating and damage reduction.

Some armours will have a strength value listed. This value is the recommended strength required to wear that armour. If your maximum strength does not meet the requirement, then you get a penalty equal to half of the difference (rounded up) known as the *armour penalty*. Only the highest armour penalty (from a single item) that you wear takes effect. Your armour penalty is applied to all combat rolls, spellcasting rolls, dexterity skill checks, deflection, evasion, and speed.

For example: if you have a maximum strength of 11, and you are wearing a piece of armour with a strength requirement of 16, you will have a -3 armour penalty.

Click [here](/Basic/Equipment.md#armour) for the rules for armour and armour features.  
Click [here](/Medieval/Equipment.md#armour) for the rules and tables for medieval weapons.

### Equipment Properties

While individual listings for equipment have specific features, they can also have certain details modified which allows for different versions of the same type of item to be represented. This can be represented as a change to that item's quality or weight, or as a material change.

In genres with magic equipment can also have magical properties with wide ranging effects. These can change how the item functions entirely or empower the user of the item.

Click [here](/Basic/Equipment.md#equipment-properties) for the rules on equipment properties.  
Click [here](/Fantasy/MagicEquipment.md) to see the rules and tables for fantasy magic equipment.

### Carrying Capacity

Many items will have a listed weight. Although it is optional to keep track of the weight of items, sometimes it might be necessary if a character is carrying an exceptional amount of them, especially if they are weak, or the items are very heavy. In this case you would need to determine the your carrying capacity. This is determined by your size, strength, and athletics. Although items do not have a listed size or bulk, use reason to determine how many large items a character can carry.

##### Table: Carrying Capacity
| Modifier | Formula |
|:-|:-|
| Light Capacity (kg) | (Max STR + Max Athletics) × 3 |
| Heavy Capacity (kg) | (Max STR + Max Athletics) × 5 |
| Tiny | Capacity × ¼ |
| Very Small | Capacity × ½ |
| Small | Capacity × ¾ |
| Medium | Capacity × 1 |
| Large | Capacity × 1½ |
| Very Large | Capacity × 2 |
| Huge | Capacity × 3 |

If a character exceeds their light capacity they become encumbered (getting a disadvantage to strength and dexterity, and have their speed halved). If they exceed their heavy capacity then they become overencumbered (and cannot move).

Casual carrying of items over extended periods of time is different than momentary displays of physical ability. Typically you can expect that someone can lift items near their heavy capacity over a very short distance, and push or drag something weighing four times that amount over a moderate distance (up to ten times that amount if assisted by wheels).

# Advancing a Character

As you play the game your character will acquire experience points. These points can then be spent to improve your character's stats and skills, and to acquire new talents. Total experience points gained and total experience points spent are tracked separately.

The rate at which characters gain experience is determined by what happens during a gaming session. As a baseline: each character receives 3 experience points at the end of every game session. For each player that met their character's motivations during that session, all players receive an additional 1 experience point. This bonus stacks for each player that met their motivations. If a major goal of the adventure is met then each player receives an additional 3 experience points. Additionally, the Game Master may award bonus experience for any other reason, either to all characters, or to individual characters.

The spending of experience points to improve a character is done in between each game session. Players may only advance individual stats, skills, or talents, once each, at each opportunity.

Some Game Masters may require certain roleplaying events to occur for the advancement of certain abilities to be permitted.

### Improving Skills

Improving a skill costs an amount of experience based on the skill step you are improving it to. An easy shortcut to determining the cost is to find the roll value that you will to improve a skill to, then take half that value.

For example: if you are improving a skill from a roll value of r8 to a roll value of r10 it will cost 5 experience points. The only exception to this is that the first time you acquire an complex skill it costs 4 experience instead of 2.

##### Table: Skill Steps & Cost
| Step Cost | Total Cost | Roll Value | Step Name |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-|
| 2 or 4<sup>1</sup> | 2 | r4 | Trained |
| 3 | 5 | r6 | Adept |
| 4 | 9 | r8 | Practiced |
| 5 | 14 | r10 | Proficient |
| 6 | 20 | r12 | Exceptional |
| 7 | 27 | r14 | Disciplined |
| 8 | 35 | r16 | Accomplished |
| 9 | 44 | r18 | Expert |
| 10 | 54 | r20 | Master |

<sup>1</sup>Becoming trained in any complex skill costs 4 experience points, while basic skills cost 2.

Languages cost half as much as other complex skills (rounded up):

##### Table: Language Steps & Cost
| Step Cost | Total Cost | Roll Value | Step Name |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-|
| 2 | 2 | r4 | Trained |
| 2 | 4 | r6 | Adept |
| 2 | 6 | r8 | Practiced |
| 3 | 9 | r10 | Proficient |
| 3 | 12 | r12 | Exceptional |
| 4 | 16 | r14 | Disciplined |
| 4 | 20 | r16 | Accomplished |
| 5 | 25 | r18 | Expert |
| 5 | 30 | r20 | Master (Fluent) |

#### Skill Limits

Skills have a maximum step that they can be advanced to, which is equal to that of their associated stat.

For example: if you have a *resolve* of r12, then the maximum that your *charisma* skill can be advanced to is also r12.

Skills can be advanced even further if that skill or its primary stat have any additive bonuses. Subtractive penalties do not reduce the maximum that a skill can be advanced.

For example: if you have a *strength* of r10+2, and a +1 bonus to *athletics* then the maximum that your *athletics* skill can be advanced to is r16, which is 3 steps past r10.

This limitation does not apply to the advancement of language skills.

### Improving Primary Stats

Improving primary stats functions very similarly to improving skills. The primary difference is that the cost is not equal to half the roll value, but is instead exactly equal to the roll value.

For example: if you are improving a primary stat from a roll value of r12 to a roll value of r14 it would cost 14 experience points.

##### Table: Primary Stat Steps & Cost
| Step Cost | Total Cost | Roll Value | Step Name |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-|
| - | - | r8 | Below Average |
| 10 | 10 | r10 | Average |
| 12 | 22 | r12 | Above Average |
| 14 | 36 | r14 | Great |
| 16 | 52 | r16 | Superb |
| 18 | 70 | r18 | Powerful |
| 20 | 90 | r20 | Epic |

#### Experience Checkpoints

There is also a second way that primary stats are improved: as your total experience gained reaches certain checkpoints you get additional bonuses to your stats for free. For every 50 total experience points gained, you will choose one of your primary stats and apply an additional +1 bonus to it. You may only choose a single primary stat twice to receive this bonus.

### Acquiring Talents

While stats and skills typically represent incremental numerical improvements to characters, talents can be acquired to provide more range of ability.

Talents that provide minor abilities cost 4 experience, while those that provide more major abilities cost 8 experience. Some talents can be acquired more than once, such as the [toughness](/Basic/Talents.md#toughness) and [extra maneuver](/Basic/Talents.md#extra-maneuver) talents. These talents may have steps, similar to stats and skills. Each time they are acquired, they will cost 1 more experience for each time you have already acquired that talent.

For example: The first time you acquire the toughness talent it will cost 4 experience, but the second and third times will each cost 5 and 6.

Although some talents are associated with certain archetypes, there are no restrictions stopping any character from acquiring another archetype's starting talent so long as all other requirements are met.
