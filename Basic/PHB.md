# The Basics

MARS features many similarities to other role-playing game systems. You will control a character that has several numerical and abstract features. These features are called *stats*, *skills*, *talents*, and *traits*. Stats and skills are represented by dice or numbers, while talents and traits represent special abilities or actions that a character can perform. As players progress they will be awarded experience points that they can spend to improve the stats and skills of their character, or to acquire new talents.

### Stats

Stats represent the innate capabilities of a character. The two types of stats are *primary stats* and *secondary stats*. Primary stats are represented by dice, and represent how well a character can perform universal tasks. Secondary stats are represented by either dice or numbers, and are the generic properties of a character. While primary stats are simply given to a character, secondary stats are derived from other sources (usually primary stats).

### Skills

Skills represent what your character is practiced in. Like primary stats, skills are represented by dice. The two types of skills are *basic skills* and *advanced skills*. Basic skills are tasks that anyone can perform, while advanced skills can only be performed by characters that are at least trained in that skill. The types of advanced skills that a character can learn are mostly dependant on the type of genre you are playing. While someone who can cast spells might be more typical of a fantasy genre, it would not be as common in a modern genre.

### Talents

Talents are powerful abilities that characters can learn. They usually provide you the ability to perform unique actions that are not simple enough to be performed by skills, or are modifiers to how a character performs their normal abilities. Most talents that can be acquired are dependant on the type of genre you are playing (similar to advanced skills).

### Traits

Traits are unique abilities that usually only belong to a single character. Typically they are something that one can do or have, and provide opportunities to roleplay in a unique way. Traits help characters stand out from other characters that would otherwise be very similar to them.

# Primary Stats

Each character has four Primary Stats that are used to derive other stats and abilities. These stats are: *Strength*, *Intelligence*, *Dexterity*, and *Resolve*. All primary stats are represented by dice ranging in value from 1d4 to 1d12. Values beyond 1d12 include additional dice. These values are called dice steps, and for primary stats, these steps range from 1d4 to 2d10.

##### Table: Primary Stat Steps
| Dice Step | Step Name |
|:-:|:-|
| 1d4 | Fragile |
| 1d6 | Weak |
| 1d8 | Below Average |
| 1d10 | Average |
| 1d12 | Above Average |
| 1d10+1d4 | Great |
| 1d10+1d6 | Superb |
| 1d10+1d8 | Powerful |
| 2d10 | Epic |

### Strength (STR)

Strength measures physical power, and general fortitude. This stat is important for atheletes, labourers, and those who engage in physical combat.

### Dexterity (DEX)

Dexterity measures the reaction speed, balance, and precision of your character. It is an important stat for characters who want to use stealth, use sleight of hand, or tinker with devices. 

### Intelligence (INT)

Intelligence determines how well your character learns and reasons. It is important for those who want to understand how complex things work, speak many languages, or recall important information. In genres that have magic it also determines a character's capacity for magical energies.

### Resolve (RES)

Resolve is the determination, willpower, intuition, and spirituality of your character. It is primarily used for characters who want to persevere through pure force of will, practice the arts or business, or communicate with others and animals.

# Secondary Stats

Characters have several secondary stats: *health*, *endurance*, *stamina*, *mana*, *initiative*, *armour class*, *damage reduction*, *deflection*, *evasion*, *fortitude*, *willpower*, *speed*, and *size*. These stats are typically calculated based on on your primary stats. Armour class and damage reduction are determined by what your character is wearing, while *speed* and *size* are determined by your character's race.

The first four secondary stats (health, endurance, stamina, and mana) are also considered *resources*. Resources have current and maximum values, and they may be spent or damaged.

##### Table: Secondary Stats
| Secondary Stat | Formula |
|:-|:-:|
| Health (HP) | Max STR |
| Endurance (EP) | Max RES |
| Stamina (SP) | Max DEX |
| Mana (MP) | Max INT |
| Initiative (INIT) | DEX + RES |
| Deflection (DEF) | RES + AC |
| Evasion (EVA) | DEX + AC |
| Fortitude (FORT) | STR + RES |
| Willpower (WILL) | INT + RES |

For example: if you have a Strength of 1d12, then you have a maximum Strength of 12 and therefore 12 Health.

### Health (HP)

Health is an abstraction representing how healthy a character is at the current moment. Any damage taken to your health represents a serious injury.

### Endurance (EP)

Endurance represents your ability to shrug off injuries before suffering serious damage, and is easy to restore with a little rest.

### Stamina (SP)

Stamina is used to perform tricks, maneuvers, and certain physical actions.

### Mana (MP)

Mana is used to cast spells and perform magical abilities.

### Initiative (INIT)

Initiative is your ability to react first in a moment of conflict.

### Armour Class (AC)

Armour class represents the effectiveness of defensive equipment to neutralize incoming attacks.

### Damage Reduction (DR)

Damage reduction represents the effectiveness of defensive equipment to reduce the force of incoming successful hits.

### Deflection (DEF)

Deflection is the capacity to shrug off incoming attacks and abilities before they can even take effect.

### Evasion (EVA)

Evasion is your ability to quickly avoid danger, rather than relying on Deflection to take hits.

### Fortitude (FORT)

Fortitude is your ability to resist poison and disease. In dire circumstances it is also used to avoid potential death.

### Willpower (WILL)

Willpower is your ability to resist temptation or supernatural influence, both mental and physical. This is not the same as preventing effects that harm the body, but instead those that control the body or mind.

### Speed (SPD)

Your speed is a measurement of your average walking distance over three seconds, or the distance you can run over one second.

### Size (SZ)

Size is measured in size categories. Most characters will be considered medium-sized, which provides no modifiers to your other stats. Certain genres and settings may provide you with additional racial options that exist in different size categories.

# Skills

Like primary stats, skill values are represented by dice steps. All skills have associated primary stats that are rolled with that skill whenever it is performed (listed next to that skill's name).

##### Table: Skill Steps
| Dice Step | Step Name |
|:-:|:-|
| - | Untrained |
| 1d4 | Trained |
| 1d6 | Adept |
| 1d8 | Practiced |
| 1d10 | Proficient |
| 1d12 | Exceptional |
| 1d10+1d4 | Disciplined |
| 1d10+1d6 | Accomplished |
| 1d10+1d8 | Expert |
| 2d10 | Master |

# Basic Skills

All characters can perform all basic skills, even if they are not trained in them. There are six basic skills: *acrobatics*, *athletics*, *charisma*, *insight*, *perception*, and *stealth*.

### Acrobatics (DEX)

You can keep your balance while traversing narrow or treacherous surfaces. You can also performs dives and flips, among other nimble feats.

### Athletics (STR)

You use the strength of your body to manipulate the world around you and move within it. You are practiced in lifting, climbing, swimming, and jumping, among other activities.

### Charisma (RES)

The capacity to convince others to follow your lead, whether that means through intimidation, deception, or appealing to emotion.

### Insight (RES)

Insight gives you a better understanding of what is going on in the minds of others. You can sense when somebody is lying to you or concealing their intentions or emotions. This includes detecting if a combatant is attempting a feint against you. Outside of reading people, insight can also provide you with some perspective into the value of goods.

### Perception (DEX)

Perception used to track animals, monsters, or people, to detect stealthy individuals, or find hidden secrets and traps.

### Stealth (DEX)

Youâ€™re skilled in concealing yourself effectively in different environments. You know how to avoid standing out, pick good hiding spots, and move silently. It can also be used to disguise your identity.

# Advanced Skills

Unlike basic skills, a character must be at least trained in an advanced skill to use it. There are seven core advanced skills: *contacts*, *knowledge*, *lore*, *medicine*, *performance*, *sleight*, and *wild empathy*. All additional types of skills, such as combat skills, spellcasting skills, and languages are all considered advanced skills.

### Contacts (RES)

Somtimes you just know someone who can get what you need done, and if you don't, maybe you know how to find one. In a city or town there's always that somebody. This skill can be used to find people in urban areas where tracking them with perception can't get the job done. It is likely that this task may involve bribes or threats.

### Knowledge (INT)

Knowledge represents your ability to recall important events, the names and details of important people, or prominent world religions. Anything pertaining to widely available but potentially unknown information. It can also be used to recall any information that someone with your character's background and skills would know (that don't fall into categories determined by the lore or medicine skills).

### Lore (INT)

Although most worldy facts can be recalled using the knowledge skill, everything else can be recalled with the lore skill. This means obscure cults and religions, secret organizations and their leaders, the occult, monsters, or magical artifacts.

### Medicine (INT)

This skill is important for anyone seeking to apply medicines and treat wounds, injuries, or illnesses. It can also be used to recognize materials, chemicals, and plants with medicinal properties, and recall knowledge on medicines and herbs.

### Performance (RES)

While charisma is used as a tool for persuasion, performance is used both for inspiring others and for literal performance. Altogether this means speeches, singing, dancing, musicianship, and so on. The limitations of this skill are determined by your background and character history or archetype (usually a character is good at performing one type of thing).

### Sleight (DEX)

Whether its traps, locks, pockets, or just fancy tricks, all such things are within your grasp. While this skill is generally used for everything a thief would do, it can also be used to conceal objects and perform magic tricks.

### Wild Empathy (RES)

In the wild, many animals are unfriendly or fearful towards the majority of people. This skill allows you to speak to and calm down such animals. It can also be used to convince certain animals, like guard dogs, that you are friendly much in the same way you could use the charisma skill to persuade someone.
