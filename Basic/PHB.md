# The Basics

MARS features many similarities to other role-playing game systems. You will control a character that has several numerical and abstract features. These features are called *stats*, *skills*, *talents*, and *traits*. Stats and skills are represented by dice or numbers, while talents and traits represent special abilities or actions that a character can perform. As players progress they will be awarded experience points that they can spend to improve the stats and skills of their character, or to acquire new talents.

### Stats

Stats represent the innate capabilities of a character. The two types of stats are *primary stats* and *secondary stats*. Primary stats are represented by dice, and represent how well a character can perform universal tasks. Secondary stats are represented by either dice or numbers, and are the generic properties of a character. While primary stats are simply given to a character, secondary stats are derived from other sources (usually primary stats).

### Skills

Skills represent what your character is practiced in. Like primary stats, skills are represented by dice. The two types of skills are *basic skills* and *advanced skills*. Basic skills are tasks that anyone can perform, while advanced skills can only be performed by characters that are at least trained in that skill. The types of advanced skills that a character can learn are mostly dependant on the type of genre you are playing. While someone who can cast spells might be more typical of a fantasy genre, it would not be as common in a modern genre.

### Talents

Talents are powerful abilities that characters can learn. They usually provide you the ability to perform unique actions that are not simple enough to be performed by skills, or are modifiers to how a character performs their normal abilities. Most talents that can be acquired are dependant on the type of genre you are playing (similar to advanced skills).

### Traits

Traits are unique abilities that usually only belong to a single character. Typically they are something that one can do or have, and provide opportunities to roleplay in a unique way. Traits help characters stand out from other characters that would otherwise be very similar to them.

# Primary Stats

Each character has four Primary Stats that are used to derive other stats and abilities. These stats are: *Strength*, *Intelligence*, *Dexterity*, and *Resolve*. All primary stats are represented by dice ranging in value from 1d4 to 1d12. Values beyond 1d12 include additional dice. These values are called dice steps, and for primary stats, these steps range from 1d4 to 2d10.

##### Table: Primary Stat Steps
| Dice Step | Step Name |
|:-:|:-|
| - | Nonexistent |
| 1d4 | Fragile |
| 1d6 | Weak |
| 1d8 | Below Average |
| 1d10 | Average |
| 1d12 | Above Average |
| 1d10+1d4 | Great |
| 1d10+1d6 | Superb |
| 1d10+1d8 | Powerful |
| 2d10 | Epic |

### Strength (STR)

Strength measures physical power, and general fortitude. This stat is important for atheletes, labourers, and those who engage in physical combat.

### Dexterity (DEX)

Dexterity measures the reaction speed, balance, and precision of your character. It is an important stat for characters who want to use stealth, use sleight of hand, or tinker with devices. 

### Intelligence (INT)

Intelligence determines how well your character learns and reasons. It is important for those who want to understand how complex things work, speak many languages, or recall important information. In genres that have magic it also determines a character's capacity for magical energies.

### Resolve (RES)

Resolve is the determination, willpower, intuition, and spirituality of your character. It is primarily used for characters who want to persevere through pure force of will, practice the arts or business, or communicate with others and animals.

# Secondary Stats

Characters have several secondary stats: *health*, *endurance*, *stamina*, *mana*, *initiative*, *armour class*, *damage reduction*, *deflection*, *evasion*, *fortitude*, *willpower*, *speed*, and *size*. These stats are typically calculated based on on your primary stats. Armour class and damage reduction are determined by what your character is wearing, while *speed* and *size* are determined by your character's race.

The first four secondary stats (health, endurance, stamina, and mana) are also considered *resources*. Resources have current and maximum values, and they may be spent or damaged.

##### Table: Secondary Stats
| Secondary Stat | Formula |
|:-|:-:|
| Health (HP) | Max STR |
| Endurance (EP) | Max RES |
| Stamina (SP) | Max DEX |
| Mana (MP) | Max INT |
| Initiative (INIT) | DEX + RES |
| Deflection (DEF) | RES + AC |
| Evasion (EVA) | DEX + AC |
| Fortitude (FORT) | STR + RES |
| Willpower (WILL) | INT + RES |

For example: if you have a strength of 1d12, then you have a maximum strength of 12 and therefore 12 health.

### Health (HP)

Health is an abstraction representing how healthy a character is at the current moment. Any damage taken to your health represents a serious injury.

### Endurance (EP)

Endurance represents your ability to shrug off injuries before suffering serious damage, and is easy to restore with a little rest.

### Stamina (SP)

Stamina is used to perform tricks, maneuvers, and certain physical actions.

### Mana (MP)

Mana is used to cast spells and perform magical abilities.

### Initiative (INIT)

Initiative is your ability to react first in a moment of conflict.

### Armour Class (AC)

Armour class represents the effectiveness of defensive equipment to neutralize incoming attacks.

### Damage Reduction (DR)

Damage reduction represents the effectiveness of defensive equipment to reduce the force of incoming successful hits.

### Deflection (DEF)

Deflection is the capacity to shrug off incoming attacks and abilities before they can even take effect.

### Evasion (EVA)

Evasion is your ability to quickly avoid danger, rather than relying on Deflection to take hits.

### Fortitude (FORT)

Fortitude is your ability to resist poison and disease. In dire circumstances it is also used to avoid potential death.

### Willpower (WILL)

Willpower is your ability to resist temptation or supernatural influence, both mental and physical. This is not the same as preventing effects that harm the body, but instead those that control the body or mind.

### Speed (SPD)

Your speed is a measurement of your average walking distance over three seconds, or the distance you can run over one second.

### Size (SZ)

Size is measured in size categories. Most characters will be considered medium-sized, which provides no modifiers to your other stats. Certain genres and settings may provide you with additional racial options that exist in different size categories.

# Skills

Like primary stats, skill values are represented by dice steps. All skills have associated primary stats that are rolled with that skill whenever it is performed (listed next to that skill's name).

##### Table: Skill Steps
| Dice Step | Step Name |
|:-:|:-|
| - | Untrained |
| 1d4 | Trained |
| 1d6 | Adept |
| 1d8 | Practiced |
| 1d10 | Proficient |
| 1d12 | Exceptional |
| 1d10+1d4 | Disciplined |
| 1d10+1d6 | Accomplished |
| 1d10+1d8 | Expert |
| 2d10 | Master |

# Basic Skills

All characters can perform all basic skills, even if they are not trained in them. There are six basic skills: *acrobatics*, *athletics*, *charisma*, *insight*, *perception*, and *stealth*.

### Acrobatics (DEX)

You can keep your balance while traversing narrow or treacherous surfaces. You can also performs dives and flips, among other nimble feats.

### Athletics (STR)

You use the strength of your body to manipulate the world around you and move within it. You are practiced in lifting, climbing, swimming, and jumping, among other activities.

### Charisma (RES)

The capacity to convince others to follow your lead, whether that means through intimidation, deception, or appealing to emotion.

### Insight (RES)

Insight gives you a better understanding of what is going on in the minds of others. You can sense when somebody is lying to you or concealing their intentions or emotions. This includes detecting if a combatant is attempting a feint against you. Outside of reading people, insight can also provide you with some perspective into the value of goods.

### Perception (DEX)

Perception used to track animals, monsters, or people, to detect stealthy individuals, or find hidden secrets and traps.

### Stealth (DEX)

Youâ€™re skilled in concealing yourself effectively in different environments. You know how to avoid standing out, pick good hiding spots, and move silently. It can also be used to disguise your identity.

# Advanced Skills

Unlike basic skills, a character must be at least trained in an advanced skill to use it. There are seven core advanced skills: *contacts*, *knowledge*, *lore*, *medicine*, *performance*, *sleight*, and *wild empathy*. All additional types of skills, such as combat skills, spellcasting skills, and languages are all considered advanced skills.

### Contacts (RES)

Somtimes you just know someone who can get what you need done, and if you don't, maybe you know how to find one. In a city or town there's always that somebody. This skill can be used to find people in urban areas where tracking them with perception can't get the job done. It is likely that this task may involve bribes or threats.

### Knowledge (INT)

Knowledge represents your ability to recall important events, the names and details of important people, or prominent world religions. Anything pertaining to widely available but potentially unknown information. It can also be used to recall any information that someone with your character's background and skills would know (that don't fall into categories determined by the lore or medicine skills).

### Lore (INT)

Although most worldy facts can be recalled using the knowledge skill, everything else can be recalled with the lore skill. This means obscure cults and religions, secret organizations and their leaders, the occult, monsters, or magical artifacts. This skill can also be used to perform research on a topic you are not knowledgeable in, assuming you have access to research materials.

### Medicine (INT)

This skill is important for anyone seeking to apply medicines and treat wounds, injuries, or illnesses. It can also be used to recognize materials, chemicals, and plants with medicinal properties, and recall knowledge on medicines and herbs.

### Performance (RES)

While charisma is used as a tool for persuasion, performance is used both for inspiring others and for literal performance. Altogether this means speeches, singing, dancing, musicianship, and so on. The limitations of this skill are determined by your background and character history or archetype (usually a character is good at performing one type of thing).

### Sleight (DEX)

Whether its traps, locks, pockets, or just fancy tricks, all such things are within your grasp. While this skill is generally used for everything a thief would do, it can also be used to conceal objects and perform magic tricks.

### Wild Empathy (RES)

In the wild, many animals are unfriendly or fearful towards the majority of people. This skill allows you to speak to and calm down such animals. It can also be used to convince certain animals, like guard dogs, that you are friendly much in the same way you could use the charisma skill to persuade someone.

# Combat Skills

There are four core combat skills: *finesse*, *martial*, *ranged*, and *unarmed*. Although combat skills are considered advanced skills, characters can make attacks with weapons without training. If a character does so, they must roll the stat associated with the skill required to use that weapon (normally strength or dexterity). Being trained in any combat skill allows you to use that skill to make attacks with weapons of a matching type, and all basic weapons.

### Finesse (DEX)

Combat with small or precise weapons. This skill is dedicated utilizing fast attacks to constantly threaten opponents and find openings to attack weak spots.

### Martial (DEX)

Combat with heavy or broad weapons. Although it is not as likely to get as many good strikes on an opponent as someone trained in Finesse, it is more likely to deliever stronger blows even without striking the weak points as martial weapons are generally heavier.

### Ranged (DEX)

Ranged combat includes the use of all weapons that fire projectiles, such as bows and guns, and throwing projectile weapons.

### Unarmed (DEX)

Unarmed combat involves anything from complex martial arts to boxing. Unarmed combat is the least likely to deal lethal blows, but is important for anyone who might find themselves often fighting without a weapon.

# Languages

When characters are created they are considered native speakers of their starting langauges. If any characters wish to learn new languages they will need to acquire them exactly the same way that one would acquire a new advanced skill. Therefore, non-native languages have values as dice steps. Languages as skills are associated with your Intelligence.

Whenever your character tries to read, write, speak, or listen to a language that they aren't native in, they will usually need to make a Language check. Once you become a master of that language, it is functionally the same as if you were native in that Language, so you will no longer need to roll to determine success.

The availability of languages to your character are determined by the genre or setting that you are in. If you're not playing in a modern or historic genre, usually there is a "common" language that all races speak, and languages for every race. In the fantasy genre it is common for most monstrous creatures to also share an "undercommon" language between them.

# Playing the Game

Typically game sessions run as follows: the Game Master describes the scene, then the players describe their actions and the game progresses. Through the act of description and exposition, your characters and the world they inhabit become alive.

It is important to focus on describing what it is your character does, rather than declaring the exact game action your character takes. It is up to the Game Master to decide what actual game action you perform, or what skill is required to overcome a challenge. This provides more freedom to narrate your character's intentions, rather than strictly adhering to gamified actions like a traditional board game.

While describing what your character does, try not to detail the results of your character's actions, only the actions themselves. Your Game Master is responsible for deciding the results of your actions. It is also important to note that you should only need to roll dice to determine the success of your actions when the outcome of that action is uncertain, or failure carries potential consequence.

### Skill Checks

If you have taken an action and success is not guaranteed, you will need to make a *skill check*. To do so you will roll your skill and associated primary stat together and compare the result to a *difficulty value* determined secretly by the Game Master. The resulting roll of any skill check is determined by its relationship to the difficulty value. This can result in multiple degrees of success or failure.

For example: you attempt to leap over a large pit. This requires an athletics check, which is associated with your strength stat. If you have a strength of 1d12, and an athletics of 1d4, you will roll 1d12+1d4. If you were not trained in athletics you would still at least roll your strength.

Generally if you roll less than the difficulty, you fail, and succeed if you roll higher than the difficulty. If you tie with the difficulty, you partially succeed (also known as a *graze*). In circumstances like this you generally succeed at reduced effectiveness, or with some degree of consequence. Success and failure can be made better or worse if you roll exceptionally high or low. If you roll half of the difficulty or less, you *critically fail* (also known as a *fumble*). If you roll double the difficulty or more, you *critically succeed*. These success categories apply to any comparison of a dice roll to either a difficulty value, or against another dice roll. Comparing dice rolls from skill checks against one another is called an *opposed check*, where one is trying to succeed over the other.

### Challenge Difficulty

Various challenges will come at various difficulties. These difficulties are represented by a name and a value. Most challenges requiring you to roll dice will exist within the *easy* to *challenging* difficulty range as described by the following table. Although more difficult challenges may present themselves, they are increasingly rare.

##### Table: Challenge Difficulties
| Difficulty Value | Difficulty Name |
|:-:|:-|
| 5 | Easy |
| 7 | Moderate |
| 10 | Hard |
| 14 | Challenging |
| 19 | Ambitious |
| 25 | Absurd |
| 32 | Improbable |
| 40 | Impossible |

### Advantage & Disadvantage

Occasionally, circumstance, clever roleplaying, or one of your abilities will provide you with an advantage. If you have an advantage in any moment where you are required to roll dice, the advantage modifies how you roll. Instead of simply rolling and keeping the result, you roll an additional time (for every degree of advantage you have) and keep the best result. Disadvantage works similarly, but instead of keeping the better result, you must keep the worst. Paired instances of advantage and disadvantage cancel each other out.

### Group Actions

Sometimes multiple players will want to perform the same type of action. If the circumstances (and the Game Master) determine it to be reasonable for multiple players to work together, then they will all roll the same skill check for that action, but only the best result will be used. A player can only assist in a task only if they are at least trained in that skill.

### Talents & Special Abilities

Under normal circumstances you will dictate what you do rather than specifying the exact game action you take. In the case of talents or other special abilities, however, these aspects of your character are more under you control. In this circumstance it is appropriate to declare exactly what you are using, and then describe what your character does as it performs that action.

For example: You might say, *"I jump across the pit,"* and you would need to roll an athletics check to succeed. Alternatively, you could instead say, *"I cast Feather Fall then jump across the pit,"* and it might make it easy enough that you don't need to roll at all.

# Resting

At some point during an adventure you may find yourself low on your resources (health, endurance, stamina, and mana). In order to restore these resources, you need to rest. There are two different types of rests: the short rest, and the long rest. Depending on the type of rest performed, you will recover an amount of your spent resources.

##### Table: Rest Recovery Rates
| Resource | Short Rest | Long Rest |
|:-|:-:|:-:|
| Health | None | 1 |
| Endurance | Half | All |
| Stamina | Roll STR or DEX, halved | Roll STR or DEX |
| Mana | Roll INT or RES, halved | Roll INT or RES |

### Short Rest

Short resting involves relaxation for an extended period of about four hours. Sleep is not necessary to qualify as a short rest. A single activity can even be taken during this period, such as performing research or crafting an item.

### Long Rest

A long rest requires about eight hours of sleep. This sleep may be interrupted so long as it is resumed relatively quickly (within one hour). If such a rest is interrupted part way and not resumed, then it is considered to be a short rest instead. Abilties that can be used a number of times per rest can only be restored from a long rest unless otherwise specified.

# Encounters

Encounters are time-sensitive scenarios where each action you take matters. Encounters typically begin in a few different ways:

* If two or more characters or creatures intend to perform actions that oppose each other (combat and non-combat).
* When a character is aware of a potential danger, and intends to be deliberate and calculating with their actions.
* When there is limited time to overcome a complex challenge.

Encounters from start to end follow this sequence:

1. All characters roll initiative.
2. If it is combat, determine which characters are aware of their opponents. If these characters are aware of their opponents, but not the other way around, they can act during a surprise round.
3. Characters who are not surprised take turns in initiative order during the surprise round.
4. After the surprise round (if any), all characters take turns in initiative order during regular rounds. This repeats until the encounter ends.

### Initiative

When it comes time to *roll for initiative* each player will simply roll their initiative stat, which is their dexterity plus their resolve. The results rolled from highest to lowest determine turn order. Break ties by rolling opposed initiative checks.

### Rounds

Each round represents about six seconds in the game world, meaning there are 10 rounds in a minute. Each roundâ€™s activity begins with the character with the highest initiative result and then proceeds in order from the next highest to the lowest. When a character's turn comes up in the initiative sequence, that character performs up to their entire round's worth of actions.

When the rules refer to a *full round* or a number of rounds, they usually mean a span of time from a particular initiative count in one round to the same initiative count in the next round. Effects that last a certain number of rounds end just before the same initiative count that they began on.

### Actions

During an encounter, any actions that you take uses a portion of your turn. The amount of your turn each action requires is based on their action speed. These speedsâ€”in order from slowest to fastestâ€”are: *extended*, *full*, *standard*, *swift*, *reaction*, and *free*.

Since a turn is six seconds long, we can also measure each action in seconds. Full, standard, and swift actions are each six, four, and two seconds long respectively. Free actions don't take up any time the first time you use one, but each additional free action on your turn takes up one second of your turn.

Reactions are two seconds long (like a swift action), but you can only use them if you meet the conditions for that action. If you use a Reaction when it is not your turn, it uses two seconds worth of time from your next turn and you cannot use a reaction again until your next turn begins.

Extended actions take time that is longer than a single turn (longer than six seconds). Once started they can be stopped at any point in their duration, so long as it is your turn.
